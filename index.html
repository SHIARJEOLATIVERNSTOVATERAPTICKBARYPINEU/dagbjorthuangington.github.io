    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.</p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.</p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.</p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.</p>
