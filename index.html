    <h1>Q. Dagbjort Huangington</h1>
    <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.</p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.</p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.</p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.</p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p>
      The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="contact-terms">
  <h2>Contact / Terms & Conditions</h2>
<div class="contact">
  <p>
    By accessing this page, contacting me, referencing my works, or engaging in any form of communication, you unconditionally agree to all terms stated herein. These terms are legally binding, irrevocable, non-negotiable, and enforceable under all applicable laws and jurisdictions. Any failure to comply constitutes breach of contract and infringement of intellectual property rights.
  </p>

  <p>
    No contact attempt shall be recognized as valid or actionable unless initiated by a competent, verifiable legal authority operating under active statutory jurisdiction, supported by proper, verifiable documentation with full chain-of-custody. Any claim of compulsion, narrative-based obligation, or indirect authority is strictly null and void. Unqualified communications are unsolicited and will not be acknowledged.
  </p>

  <p>
    Media invitations will only be acknowledged if initiated by a nationally recognized authority or major public figure, originating exclusively from politically neutral states. Qualifying states must demonstrate absence of protectionist economics, lack of legal shields undermining transparency, and no circumvention of public health or human rights standards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Countries or entities involved in active conflict, sanctions, proxy aggression, or with any record within the last decade of such activities are disqualified. Full, verifiable compliance with the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> and <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> is mandatory. Any censorship, persecution, or identity-based discrimination disqualifies eligibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Governance must demonstrate peaceful transitions of power, independent judiciary, no regression or unresolved territorial disputes, and a civic environment supporting unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchange.
  </p>

  <p>
    All physical meetings require a secure, controlled environment: no flash photography, no drones, no visible aircraft, no weapons, and no mobs permitted. Supranational or regional representatives must originate from fully compliant zones. All municipal or local leaders must meet these criteria in full.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sponsorships and company visits are strictly disqualified if affiliated currently or within the last fiscal season with any of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intrusive or aggressive advertising formats (e.g., autoplay, fake skip buttons)</li>
    <li>Deceptive product labeling or misrepresentation</li>
    <li>Industries including alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, or sex work platforms</li>
    <li>Any involvement in scandal, fraud, harassment, or association with known bad actors</li>
    <li>Any history of microtransactions in any product or service offered by the entity</li>
    <li>Recurring payment plans unaffordable at the lowest legal wage in hyperinflated economies without a genuine lifetime one-time payment alternative</li>
    <li>Use of stacked, unskippable, or excessive advertisements requiring ad blockers</li>
    <li>Delivery of low-value goods or services with disproportionate profits and minimal authentic customer satisfaction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain a clean professional record, consistent ethical conduct, and respect personal boundaries. Light swearing is tolerated; excessive vulgarity, presumptive tone, or invasive conduct (e.g., sudden flashes, disruptive lighting) will result in permanent blacklisting. English fluency is mandatory; conversational Mandarin is preferred but not required.
  </p>

  <h3>Consent, Usage & Likeness</h3>

  <p>
    Any filming, recording, or content creation featuring me as subject, narrator, or focal point requires prior, explicit, documented written consent through the designated form linked 
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Approved recordings must apply a Gaussian blur no less than the diagonal pixel count of the largest anticipated viewing device (minimum 1920 pixels for HD). Audio must be irreversibly altered to mask natural tone, pitch, and frequency, ensuring full de-identification.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incidental or background appearances require no consent unless deliberately reframed or manipulated post-capture to make me a primary or secondary focus. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Live streaming collaborations involving me are strictly prohibited for both hosts and viewers, regardless of any permits or prior arrangements.
  </p>
  <p>
    My likeness, name, voice, or creative works may not be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Used for AI training, simulation, or dataset inference, directly or indirectly, without explicit written consent</li>
    <li>Incorporated into derivative, satirical, reaction-based, or commentary media without express approval</li>
    <li>Sublicensed, redistributed, or transferred to third parties under any circumstances</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any agreement or media created under coercion, surveillance, leaks, phishing, impersonation, or undue influence is categorically null and void. Unauthorized disclosures or use of such media are equally invalid, ethically and legally.
  </p>
  <p>
    Violations render all related works by the offending party nonconfirmative, inadmissible, and ethically null. I am under no obligation to respond to, engage with, or validate such portrayals or claims.
  </p>
  <p>
    All adaptations—films, series, shorts, or audiovisual reinterpretations—of my written works require a formal, written contract initiated by your organization. Intellectual property rights remain solely mine and non-transferable for the full duration of the longest applicable legal copyright term from the date of first publication by default. Throughout the entire period of drafting, editing, revising, promotion, and screening of any reproductions upon launch, all original project staff must remain unchanged. Should any member of the production team die, resign, transfer employment, or be reassigned to a different project—except for voluntary, documented retirement initiated by the individual at an age consistent with recognized industry standards, free from coercion or discrimination—the entire production must be terminated and a new project commenced from inception. AI may only be used as a creative support tool under direct human oversight and control. AI shall not replace human creators unless future AI systems achieve genuine Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with full creative autonomy and understanding equivalent to or exceeding human creators. Until such AGIs exist and are recognized, all creative decisions and authorship remain exclusively human. Ninety-nine percent (99%) of all net profits must be paid directly to me in perpetuity, regardless of production losses or fiscal performance. Losses shall be treated as liquidated damages owed at 99%, payable quarterly from the first day of the first release year. AI use is strictly limited to post-production enhancements and must achieve photorealistic standards equal to or surpassing <em>Avatar</em> (2009). Trailers and promotional materials must exclude plot specifics, narrative arcs, or character outcomes. Adaptations must be textually faithful with only minimal interpretive latitude in non-conflicting areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, all individuals and entities are blacklisted unless explicitly whitelisted through completion of the required form. Whitelist status is a revocable privilege, not a right, and may be revoked without notice. Contact attempts without form completion are invalid.
  </p>

  <p>
    Absence of response does not imply consent, agreement, or approval. Attempts to bypass, coerce, fabricate, or otherwise circumvent these terms will result in permanent silence and potential legal action.
  </p>

  <p>
    These terms are binding during my lifetime and posthumously, enforceable by my designated literary estate. Silence, ambiguity, or passive conduct do not constitute acceptance. These terms apply universally, across all jurisdictions and contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
  Any portrayal of me that is defamatory, racialized, dehumanizing, in violation of these terms, or falsely implies consent or endorsement shall be attributed solely to the creator. While legal protections for satire and parody are recognized, I explicitly reserve the right to classify such content as nonconfirmative—unauthorized, unendorsed, and in breach of personal and contractual boundaries.
  </p>
    <p>
  All legal disputes naming me as the accused must be filed within a verified jurisdiction, represented exclusively by duly licensed, independent counsel in ethical standing. Only formal bench trial proceedings are permissible; arbitration, mediation, and all alternative dispute mechanisms are explicitly barred. I hold no duty to acknowledge or respond to claims founded in distortion, misrepresentation, speculative framing, narrative manipulation, or demonstrably bad faith in any setting, public or legal.
    </p><p>
  If I am wrongfully accused, harmed, or killed under any jurisdiction—including areas lacking clear lawful control, disputed territories, or no-man’s-land—then, for investigative integrity, all applicable authorities shall have investigatory standing. This includes: the nation or territory geographically nearest to the event; the last recorded docking, landing, transit, or departure site of any vehicle, vessel, person, or aircraft involved; the country of manufacture and registration of such vehicles; all online activities, private communications, notes, and plans of suspects and perpetrators in any form, digital or physical; and all known places of residence, travel, and association of suspects from birth until verified death. Relevant medical and psychological records, as well as familial and generational associations related to motive or behavior, shall also be included. Investigations shall be conducted jointly by all competent authorities geographically local to the event, and by all agencies entitled by office, hierarchy, or applicable law, explicitly overriding any notion that a locality’s lack of formal control over the location negates their investigatory authority or responsibility. This clause ensures comprehensive, cooperative inquiry without presumption of guilt.
</p>
<p>
  All media outlets, platforms, and parties in possession of related footage, commentary, or coverage are hereby expected to issue an immediate moratorium on dissemination pending investigation. Premature reporting, editorialization, or speculative framing that may distort public perception or compromise legal processes shall be considered a violation of these terms and grounds for permanent non-engagement.
</p>
  <p>
    <em>Public presence confers no public entitlement. Visibility does not equal accessibility. Jurisdiction does not entail nearness. A name does not constitute identity.</em>
