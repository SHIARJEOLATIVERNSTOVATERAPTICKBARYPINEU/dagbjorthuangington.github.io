    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.
    </p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.
    </p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set to myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.

<div class="contact">
<em>Effective Immediately and Indefinitely</em>
<p><em>Side Note: terms like me, my, and I do not refer to the reader and those who agree to the terms and conditions but the creator under this pen name, unless by word context that it applies to the binding entity.</em></p>
<p>
By accessing this website—regardless of intent, method, or point of entry—you hereby unconditionally agree to the following legally binding Terms of Use and Conditional License Agreement. These terms apply globally, without exception, and are considered enforceable under all relevant national and international jurisdictions.
</p><p>
If you do not accept these terms in full, you are required to exit this website immediately and, in any event, no later than three (3) cumulative seconds after reading this sentence. Any continued or repeated access or use of any part of this website beyond that period shall constitute full, informed, and legally binding agreement to all terms outlined herein.
</p><p>
    No attempt at contact, communication, or engagement shall be considered valid, legally actionable, or acknowledged unless such attempt is initiated by a competent and verifiable legal authority possessing active statutory jurisdiction. This must be substantiated by verifiable documentation establishing an unbroken chain of custody in compliance with recognized evidentiary standards. Any claims predicated upon alleged compulsion, purported narrative obligations, or asserted indirect or derivative authority are hereby declared null, void, and without effect. Communications failing to meet these criteria are deemed unsolicited and will be categorically disregarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Invitations extended by media or similar entities shall be recognized as valid only if initiated by nationally recognized authorities or major public figures originating exclusively from politically neutral states. Political neutrality herein excludes individuals or entities with explicit, documented affiliations—formal or informal—to either right-wing or left-wing ideological frameworks, irrespective of their official capacities. A state is deemed ineligible if it fails to demonstrate transparent governance, consistently uphold fundamental human rights, or maintain a documented record free from protectionist or censorial practices. Such practices include, but are not limited to, deportation or exclusion of foreign nationals under the pretense of patriotism, enacted / voted in / allowed tariffs within the last ten tenures as a federal or state worker, and has any soceitcal crisises of turning otherwise unpolitical subjects of discussion into political subjects of discussion. States enacting legislation or policies contravening these principles—and additional requirements outlined herein—are permanently disqualified from eligibility unless such actions are reversed via enforceable, transparent legal measures that explicitly preclude recurrence through loopholes, discretionary abuse, or procedural evasion. Symbolic gestures, legislative repeals without enforcement, or administrative delays shall not constitute reinstatement of eligibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entities actively engaged in armed conflict, subjected to or imposing sanctions, participating in proxy aggression, or possessing documented violations of the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> or <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> within the preceding ten-year period shall be categorically disqualified from eligibility under these Terms and Conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any country, territory, jurisdiction, or entity shall be considered <strong>ineligible</strong> for any form of engagement, collaboration, or correspondence governed by these Terms and Conditions if it maintains, supports, or has a documented historical pattern—whether direct, indirect, or by proxy—of military buildup, arms expansion, or force projection during periods of declared peacetime. This disqualification applies regardless of whether such activities are conducted independently, through occupation, allied presence, or via proxy agreements. Ineligibility also extends to jurisdictions engaged in militarized economic zones, defense-focused industrial subsidies, or habitual mobilizations justified by deterrence or strategic posturing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exceptions to the foregoing disqualifications are made exclusively for jurisdictions meeting all of the following cumulative criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Maintain no standing military forces, do not host foreign military bases or allied forces, and refrain from any covert or overt military cooperation—including during periods of internal instability—unless such cooperation ceased immediately following the removal of leadership regimes found to have willfully violated the principles outlined in the preceding paragraph;
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate internationally recognized political neutrality, exemplified by states such as the Swiss Confederation;
    </li>
    <li>
      Hold memberships exclusively in international or supranational organizations whose founding charters explicitly mandate non-military scopes, such as humanitarian, cultural, or scientific objectives. Such affiliations must not be exploited as conduits for soft influence, associative branding, or diplomatic circumvention of these terms.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any past or present affiliation with militarized entities shall override any non-military affiliations upon involvement—directly, indirectly, or by proxy—in armed conflict, weapons supply, or proxy war engagement. This disqualification includes actions framed as morally justified, preemptive, ideological, retaliatory, or otherwise—such as the Vietnam conflict—where such justifications lack enduring ethical consensus or result in conflicts deemed senseless or disproportionate by post-engagement evaluations. Announcements of war cessation or peace declarations—such as those following early post-9/11 military operations—shall not reinstate eligibility if residual or systemic consequences persist.
  </p>
<p> Any diplomatic, economic, or military coalition, alliance, or collective grouping of states that, through its coordinated economic, military, or political actions, seeks to exert disproportionate influence over global governance, economic systems, or military affairs—particularly in a way that undermines principles of political neutrality, non-interference, or sovereign independence—shall be excluded under this agreement. This includes entities that, despite claiming neutrality or non-militarization, are found to engage in indirect military cooperation, defense-related trade, or strategic political maneuvering that disrupts global peace or democratic self-determination. </p> <p> This exclusion applies to entities or groupings that meet the following criteria: </p> <ul> <li>Form multi-nation economic, military, or political alliances whose actions directly or indirectly influence or control sovereign states or their internal decisions, particularly through soft power tactics such as economic pressure, resource manipulation, or coercive diplomacy;</li> <li>Engage in military cooperation, including arms deals, joint defense agreements, or other security arrangements that extend beyond their own territorial boundaries, effectively supporting or enabling conflicts or geopolitical instability;</li> <li>Collaborate with other states, corporations, or entities in a manner that concentrates power or strategic influence, undermining democratic processes, self-determination, or the principles of equity and mutual respect in international relations;</li> <li>Attempt to circumvent or manipulate neutral international laws, norms, or agreements, including the imposition of economic sanctions, resource monopolization, or influencing international bodies in ways that go against the spirit of fair and impartial governance.</li> </ul> <p> Furthermore, any subsequent formations or new alliances that exhibit the same behaviors—regardless of their name, formal structure, or claimed ideological positions—shall be similarly excluded from engagement under these terms. </p>
  <p>
    Any form of prestige-based infiltration, soft power maneuvering, associative branding, or diplomatic Trojan-horse tactics intended to bypass these Terms and Conditions—whether through joint ventures, celebrity endorsements, honorary designations, or cultural ambassadorships—shall constitute a direct violation of these Terms. Eligibility requires not only formal nonalignment but also demonstrable absence of intent, infrastructure, or proxy mechanisms capable of undermining these terms through implication, association, or covert influence. Consequently, any attempt to gain an invitation from a state, provincial, supranational, or federal body, either on a piece of land surrounded by a disqualified country or located within the territory of a disqualified country, shall invalidate the inclusion of such a scenario. This includes scenarios where I may be invited to space, sea, or underground environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Governance structures must exhibit peaceful power transitions, maintain independent judiciaries, resolve territorial disputes amicably, and support unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchanges without censorship or undue interference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Physical meetings shall occur exclusively in secure, controlled environments that prohibit flash photography, drone operation, visible aircraft, weapons possession, and unauthorized gatherings. Representatives attending such meetings must originate from jurisdictions fully compliant with all preceding criteria.
  </p>
  <p>
  Sponsorships and company visits are categorically disqualified if the entity is—currently or within the past several fiscal years after a primary niche shift—affiliated with any of the following. Terms are interpreted in accordance with all applicable jurisdictions, from national to local levels:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intrusive or deceptive advertising practices, including but not limited to autoplay media or fake skip buttons;</li>
  <li>Misleading product labeling, false representation, or deceptive marketing tactics;</li>
  <li>Industries engaged in alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, armaments, or sex work platforms;</li>
  <li>Entities implicated in scandals, fraud, harassment, or associations with known bad actors;</li>
  <li>Use of microtransactions without a lifetime or one-time payment alternative;</li>
  <li>Recurring payment models unaffordable at the lowest legal wage within hyperinflated economies;</li>
  <li>Advertising formats that are stacked, unskippable, or so excessive they necessitate the use of ad blockers;</li>
  <li>Provision of low-value goods or services yielding disproportionate profits with minimal genuine customer benefit;</li>
  <li>Entities promoting privacy while having publicly exposed protected user data at least once;</li>
  <li>Production of shovelware or similarly defined low-effort products;</li>
  <li>Any rebranding, niche-shifting, or shell company restructuring intended to circumvent these disqualifiers;</li>
  <li>
    Entities whose business model relies on excessive or unnecessary profit margins at the direct expense of consumer welfare—via exploitative pricing, deceptive bundling, disaster profiteering, or artificial scarcity. The allowable net profit for such entities shall not exceed <strong>twice</strong> their total operating costs for the most recent fiscal year, with <strong>50%</strong> of that profit reinvested into sustainable operations and the remainder reserved for contingencies or reinvestment.
    <br><em>Operating costs</em> are defined as all expenses necessary to run the business, including post-investor distributions, dividends, and other investor-related outflows.
    <br>Evidence of underreporting, overreporting, or non-audited estimations shall trigger <strong>personal liability</strong>, not that of the partnership.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Any entity—whether a business corporation, non-governmental organization (NGO), non-profit with commercial activities, or other revenue-generating body—seeking partnership, sponsorship, or collaboration must demonstrate full and verifiable compliance with the above requirements, regardless of its tax classification, legal structure, or declared mission. Verification requires submission of financial documentation adhering to internationally recognized standards, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Publicly available annual reports;</li>
  <li>Audited financial statements;</li>
  <li>Regulatory filings to relevant oversight bodies in all jurisdictions of operation;</li>
  <li>Or equivalent disclosures under GAAP, IFRS, or jurisdictionally mandated accounting standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Multinational entities must submit consolidated financials covering all subsidiaries, branches, and cross-border operations. Fragmentation or selective reporting designed to obscure true profitability will result in automatic disqualification.
</p>
<p>
  Any falsification, evasion, or material omission of required disclosures will result in immediate liability, cancellation of any agreements, and permanent exclusion from future eligibility under these terms. The burden of proof rests solely with the entity.
</p>
<p>
    Education, health, and other unmentioned institutions who want to contact me in any way must likewise be bound by ethics and law, wherein they shall not have a recent 10-year history of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initiating, encouraging, or spreading medical, historical, scientific, or legal disinformation/misinformation;</li>
    <li>Any ban-listed items off of the sponsorships and company visits list from way before this sentence (implied included);</li>
    <li>Demonstrated largely black hat hacking, distribution of malware, or otherwise (including those who rented even a chair or a desk to one bad actor in this list item);</li>
    <li>Dropping a rank or multiple ranks among their state/province education systems regarding not the sports, but the academic competencies to achieve at least a CTE level;</li>
    <li>Having a history of medical or legal malpractice;</li>
    <li>One incident of any terrorism (mainly a crime of which fear is instilled upon innocence) committed by one of their members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual creators, sole proprietors, or unincorporated merch sellers are presumed exempt from financial disclosure obligations under these terms unless operating under a formal business entity structure or receiving third-party brand sponsorship.</p>

<p>Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain ethical conduct, respect all personal and professional boundaries, and possess verified fluency in the English language. Excessive vulgarity, presumptive tone, invasive behavior, or breach of conduct standards shall result in permanent blacklisting.</p>

<p>Filming, recording, or content creation featuring me as the primary subject or focal point requires prior explicit written consent obtained via the designated form accessible 
<a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Any content in which I appear—granted only under explicit, documented, and prior consent—must comply with the following mandatory safeguards: all visual frames featuring my image must apply a localized Gaussian blur mask fully encompassing my entire figure. The resolution of this mask must be no less than the diagonal pixel count of the largest commercially available device anticipated in the distribution, publication, or playback chain. All accompanying audio tracks must be irreversibly modified to obscure my natural tone, pitch, cadence, and frequency profile. Furthermore, each visual frame must be post-processed—whether after live stream or recorded production—using robust AI poisoning techniques explicitly designed to render the content unsuitable for training datasets, machine learning inference, or generative model synthesis.</p>

<p>At no point—whether prior to release, during recording, or post-release—may the content creator disclose any information beyond acknowledgment of collaboration and the fact of meeting me. Any mention or implication of knowledge regarding my appearance, scent, voice, or any biometric identifiers is strictly prohibited. These conditions serve as preemptive safeguards against misuse by malicious actors irrespective of jurisdiction, intent, or affiliation.</p>

<p>Unauthorized publication or dissemination of my unaltered facial likeness, voice, or biometric identifiers by any external party constitutes a direct and actionable violation of these Terms and Conditions. Such breaches will trigger immediate and automatic eternal blacklisting of the individual and all affiliated parties. At my sole discretion, a formal takedown request may be issued, requiring full compliance without delay or objection. Continued possession or distribution of infringing material after notice shall constitute willful infringement, potentially provoking legal action across all relevant jurisdictions and resulting in permanent disqualification from future collaborations regardless of subsequent forgiveness requests. This includes stalking of any form.</p>

<p>Defamatory, racialized, dehumanizing, or falsely consenting portrayals—regardless of format—are the sole responsibility of their creators. While satire and parody protections under applicable law are recognized, such content may still be publicly declared unauthorized and unendorsed by me. Legal tolerance does not imply ethical alignment. All creators assume full accountability for reputational, social, and legal consequences arising therefrom.</p>

<p>Incidental appearances require no prior consent unless the footage is deliberately reframed to present me as a primary, secondary, or one of the many subjects of focus. All live stream collaborations must comply fully with the conditions outlined herein and related provisions.</p>

<p>My likeness, name, voice, habits, or creative works may not be used for AI training, derivative media, sublicensing, or transfer without explicit prior written consent. Subsequently, the violation of this paragraph and the ones above is not a ticket to add to the pressure which may be called a push for an official face or voice reveal, but if so, the viewers and hosts have to consent to seeing me with identity masked for the rest of my life.</p>

  <p>To protect against fraud and unauthorized use, you agree to provide a valid, permanent email address for communication and verification purposes. Temporary, disposable, bot-created, or otherwise fake email addresses are prohibited due to risks such as phishing, spoofing, and other email-based scams. Phone numbers may be provided but carry inherent security vulnerabilities, including SIM swapping. Social media or other online accounts are not accepted forms of contact due to similar susceptibilities. Contact information collected will be used solely for identity confirmation, fraud prevention, and essential business communications. Failure to provide accurate contact details may result in suspension or termination of services, including cancellation of meetings, without notice.</p>

<p>Agreements or media produced under coercion, surveillance, phishing, impersonation, or any undue influence are null, void, and unenforceable both ethically and legally. Unauthorized disclosures under such circumstances hold no validity. Violations render offending works non-conformative, inadmissible, and ethically void within the public record. The rights holder is under no obligation to acknowledge, respond to, or validate such portrayals, which shall be presumed self-discrediting unless proven otherwise under applicable law.</p>

<p>Any adaptations require formal, written contracts. Intellectual property rights remain exclusively with the rights holder and are non-transferable for the full legal copyright term, commencing no later than the publication date featuring the subject; extensions apply only concerning the literary legacy. Throughout drafting, editing, promotion, and distribution—including screenings, sales, and reviews—the original production staff must remain unchanged. Any death, resignation, transfer, or reassignment, except voluntary retirement at industry-standard age without coercion, results in project termination and restart. Continuation under such conditions risks voiding further interaction with all involved parties.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be employed solely as a creative support tool under direct human supervision. The replacement of human creators by AI is strictly prohibited unless a demonstrably true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with full creative autonomy is achieved. Such AGI must consistently generate content with frame-to-frame coherence, logical object placement, accurate colors, and sound design. AI use is further limited to photorealistic post-production enhancements that meet or exceed the highest quality standards awarded in relevant categories from the previous year or the highest award at the time of production for multi-year projects. Authorized promotional materials must exclude plot details and character outcomes. Authorized adaptations must remain textually faithful, permitting minimal interpretive latitude only in ambiguous or unspecified source material.</p>

<p>Ninety-nine percent (99%) of all net profits from creation, publication, distribution, adaptation, or commercialization of any third-party work incorporating the rights holder’s original intellectual property—including but not limited to characters, items, settings, or narrative constructs—shall be payable in perpetuity for the duration of copyright. Financial losses incurred by such third-party works shall be treated as liquidated damages at the same 99% rate, payable in equal installments every forty-six (46) calendar days beginning the first full calendar year after initial public release.</p>

<p>Any third-party creation, distribution, sale, or adaptation of merchandise, media, or derivative works based on the intellectual property requires express written authorization and remains subject to the compensation terms stated above, regardless of medium, platform, or scale. Publishing or distribution platforms explicitly engaged by the rights holder—such as Draft2Digital or equivalents—are recognized solely as intermediaries with no derivative or commercial rights beyond facilitating distribution. This exception does not extend to third parties independently using such platforms without explicit authorization and who remain fully subject to compensation and restrictions herein.</p>

<p>Profitability or commercial success shall not affect the enforceability of compensation clauses. Works archived solely for historical preservation are exempt from commercial use, royalties, and damage claims, remaining permanently closed and untouched. Any entity aware of these archival terms is strictly prohibited from accessing or modifying archived works, with violations treated as unauthorized handling of protected historic artifacts.</p>

<p>All adaptations, third-party works, or derivative creations—including those substantially similar or recontextualized—must provide clear, visible attribution to the original creator using the designated pen name in all public versions or distributions. Attribution and compensation obligations apply universally and without exception to parties who monetize the work, delegate creation, or manage combined staff and audience counts exceeding three (3) individuals.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with attribution and compensation requirements results in permanent disqualification from current or future collaborations or licensing, and may prompt enforcement actions such as takedown notices, cease-and-desist orders, public revocation, and legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Attempts to contact the rights holder not using the designated pen name or seeking information related to it will be treated as coercive, terminating communications without notice. Ignorance of these terms or attempts to circumvent them through technical or semantic means shall not excuse noncompliance. Circumvention or dilution of required attribution through indirect publication, pseudonym use, proxy entities, or other methods constitutes material breach subject to remedies.</p>

<p>Malicious, unlawful, or harassing activities toward the rights holder or affiliates—including harassment, false crime reports (“swatting”), vandalism, unauthorized surveillance, doxing, blackmail, or paparazzi-style intrusion—are strictly forbidden and subject to immediate termination of access and legal recourse. These terms apply universally across jurisdictions, including off-platform and third-party actions.</p>

<p>All parties are blacklisted by default unless explicitly whitelisted through designated consent forms, with confirmation granted only via the rights holder’s emailed reply. Denials redirect correspondents to these Terms and Conditions. Contact attempts without completed forms or with materially false or vague reasons shall be invalid. Failure to respond does not imply consent. Attempts to falsify consent evidence result in permanent refusal of future contact and possible legal action.</p>

<p>The entity under this pen name reserves sole discretion to streamline procedural requirements for limited, known creators, without exempting any provision. Any substantiated violation evidenced by preexisting content leads to immediate disqualification until a public apology is issued (excluding the pen name entity). Whitelist status is strictly limited to declared purposes at consent and any unauthorized extension or alteration results in immediate revocation and blacklisting without grace period.</p>

<p>These Terms are binding during the rights holder’s lifetime and posthumously, enforceable by a designated literary estate or appointed executors/trustees. Any executor or trustee publicly discrediting or undermining these Terms shall be deemed illegitimate and stripped of all rights and authority, required to appoint a qualified successor or transfer responsibility to a competent relative or institution. Failure of all designations results in automatic, irrevocable reversion to an all-rights-reserved status for the maximum copyright term under the nearest sovereign country recognized by at least three major intergovernmental organizations, with strong civil liberty protections.</p>

<p>Such default status remains binding unless a legitimate, qualified successor emerges before expiration. Executors designating time capsules as successors must also name a secondary sentient successor capable of immediate continuation, with all amendments formally notarized and signed in duplicate. No implied agreements are recognized.</p>

<p>The intellectual property—including all patents, trademarks, copyrights, and tangible and intangible assets—remains strictly non-transferable. No sale, license, sublicense, assignment, or transfer to third parties is permitted without explicit written consent. Consent is revoked by implication if contract terms are extended or delayed, requiring separate agreements. Unlawful attempts to acquire or circumvent IP ownership render perpetrators jointly liable with debts and interest equating multiple lifetimes of liability.</p>

<p>Attempts to circumvent provisions by indirect means or financial arrangements result in immediate liability and disqualification. The public is advised to treat any unauthorized accounts or claims impersonating this IP as unreliable. Financial structures or transfers appearing designed to bypass restrictions are violations subject to legal consequences.</p>

<p>All disputes arising from this agreement, including IP enforcement or interpretation, shall be resolved exclusively by bench trial in the rights holder’s jurisdiction at the time of dispute. The presiding judge must have expertise in IP law or commercial contracts. Jury trials or alternative dispute resolutions are waived and dismissed. Trials exceeding ninety (90) days are void. Bad-faith accusers may be penalized with legal fees and damages.</p>

<p>Official communications must use designated contact points only. This document supersedes all prior statements or understandings.</p>
