    <h1>Q. Dagbjort Huangington</h1>
    <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.</p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.</p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.</p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.</p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p>
      The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="contact-terms">
  <h2>Contact / Terms & Conditions</h2>
  <div class="contact">
    <p>
      No question, inquiry, or contact attempt shall be considered valid or actionable unless issued directly by a competent, verifiable legal authority under active statutory jurisdiction, with proper documentation and chain-of-custody traceability. Self-ascribed or performative claims of compulsion (e.g., “I was told by [entity] to contact you”) are categorically invalid. Communications from individuals, organizations, or states that do not meet the explicit qualifications below are to be treated as unsolicited and will not be acknowledged under any pretense. Engagement shall occur only in response to formally authenticated legal mandates, not narrative claims of obligation or indirect affiliation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Media invitations—present or future—will only be acknowledged if initiated by a recognized authority or nationally recognized major public figure, subject to strict and non-negotiable hierarchical evaluation. National-level representatives must originate from states demonstrating <strong>political neutrality</strong>: no protectionist economics, no discriminatory legal shields, and no sub- or supra-national constructs used to bypass accountability or public health standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countries must not be engaged in conflict, civil unrest, or martial law, and must show no record within the last decade of initiating or supporting warfare or proxy aggression. <strong>Full adherence</strong> to conventions such as the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> and <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> is mandatory; censorship, persecution of journalists or creatives, and identity-based punishment are immediate grounds for disqualification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Legitimate governance requires peaceful transitions of power, independent judiciary systems, and no history of regression under scrutiny. Qualified states must also be free of sanctions, unresolved territorial disputes, and open cases relating to crimes against humanity. The civic environment must promote unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchange—free from ideological filters or propaganda redirection.
    </p>

    <p>
      All physical meetings require a <strong>no-flash, no-drone, no-visible-aircraft, no-weapons, no-mobbing safety zone centered around the interviewer(s) and the interviewee</strong>. Supranational or regional figures may only represent fully compliant zones and must not leverage interaction to legitimize non-compliant entities. Municipal leaders must govern conflict-free areas and meet all higher-tier criteria in full.
    </p>
    <p>
  Sponsorships and company figure visits are disqualified if the company is currently, or was within the past fiscal season, affiliated with any of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intrusive or aggressive advertising formats (e.g., RAID: Shadow Legends-style repetition, autoplay ads, fake skip buttons)</li>
  <li>Deceptive labeling (e.g., hidden sugars, manipulated statistics, misleading percentages)</li>
  <li>Industries including but not limited to: alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, or sex work platforms</li>
  <li>Involvement in any scandal, fraud, harassment incident, or documented proximity to bad actors</li>
  <li>Games or apps featuring any form of microtransactions, regardless of type or amount. This applies to all of any company's product history, not just the past fiscal season.</li>
  <li>Recurring-payment plans—including deferred-cost or disguised-subscription models—not fully affordable at the lowest legal wage in the most hyperinflated global currency, unless a true lifetime one-time-payment alternative is likewise affordable</li>
  <li>Products whose ads routinely require ad blockers to prevent more than one minute of unskippable or stacked content, including ads from blacklisted or equivalent industries</li>
  <li>Delivered low-value goods or services ("pyrite") while receiving disproportionate profit ("golden eggs"), with only minimal authentic customer satisfaction—manipulated, incentivized, or fake reviews are inadmissible</li>
</ul>
    <p>Any for or non-profit organization must likewise be true in accordance to all applicable requirements of companies before this paragraph and all (100%) of the requirements in the next paragraph as well as all regarding countries, regardless of beleif.</p>
    <p>
      Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain a clean professional record, uphold individual dignity, and demonstrate consistent ethical conduct. Light swearing is tolerated; <strong>excessive vulgarity, unsolicited proposals, presumptive tone, or invasive behavior</strong> (flashes, sudden lighting, etc.) may result in blacklisting. English fluency is required (ESL or equivalent); conversational Mandarin is preferred but not mandatory.
    </p>
    <h3>Consent, Usage & Likeness</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Filming with intent</strong>—where I appear as subject, narrator, or focal point—requires prior, explicit, verifiable, and revocable consent, documented through the designated form linked 
      <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Approved recordings must apply a Gaussian blur at minimum equal to the diagonal pixel count of the largest anticipated viewing device (no less than 1920 pixels for HD screens). All audio must be irreversibly altered to mask natural tone, pitch, and frequency, ensuring complete de-identification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Incidental appearances (background only) require no consent unless reframed or manipulated post-capture to make me a partial or immediate focus. <strong>Live streaming collaborations is strictly prohibited—for both streamers and viewers—even if conducted under permit.</strong> These terms apply equally to influencers and independent content creators, regardless of reach or platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      My likeness, name, voice, or creative works may not be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulated, trained upon, or inferred into AI models or datasets, directly or indirectly, without explicit written consent</li>
      <li>Used in derivative, reaction-based, satirical, or commentary media without express approval</li>
      <li>Sublicensed, redistributed, or transferred to third parties under any circumstances</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Any agreement obtained through surveillance, leaks, phishing, coercion, constraint, or undue influence is categorically void. Media created or disseminated under such conditions—including unauthorized disclosures—shall be considered equally invalid, both ethically and legally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any violation of these terms—especially unauthorized use of my likeness, name, voice, or creative works in AI training, satire, reaction content, or remixing—renders all related past or future works by the offending party <strong>nonconfirmative</strong>: inadmissible, lacking credibility, and ethically null. I bear no obligation to engage with, address, or validate any representation, implication, or accusation derived from such violations. Favorable or defamatory, such portrayals carry no evidentiary weight regarding my actions, character, misdeeds, or accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
Any video adaptation—including but not limited to films, shorts, series, or any form of audiovisual reinterpretation—of any of my written works, whether part of a series or standalone, requires a formal written contract initiated exclusively by your organization; under no circumstances shall this contract grant, imply, or facilitate any transfer, licensing, dilution, sub-licensing, or shared control of rights to the original intellectual property; no adaptation—regardless of scale, distribution reach, critical reception, or commercial outcome—shall override, supersede, redefine, or in any way diminish my sole, exclusive, and permanent ownership of the underlying IP; the contract must explicitly and irrevocably guarantee that 99% of all net profits derived from any such adaptation are paid directly to me in perpetuity, regardless of your organization’s fiscal performance, production liabilities, distribution obligations, or internal accounting practices; in the event the adaptation reports net losses, your organization shall be contractually required to pay a compensatory amount equal to 99% of said losses directly to me, treated as liquidated damages—not a penalty—in recognition of my uncompensated authorship and continued retention of all rights; all payments, whether derived from profit or loss, must be disbursed quarterly, no later than the final calendar day of each fiscal quarter, beginning from the first day of the production’s release year; the use of artificial intelligence is strictly limited to post-production enhancement of visuals and audio and is categorically prohibited from replacing or generating human performance, authorship, or creative decision-making, unless it verifiably and consistently achieves photorealistic results equal to or surpassing Avatar (2009), not the artificial stylization exhibited in the 2025 “petticoated” digital stand-ins; all trailers and promotional content must be limited exclusively to the premise or thematic scope of the source material and must not include specific plot details, narrative arcs, character outcomes, or major developments; adaptations must remain textually faithful to the original work, with narrow interpretive leeway granted only to choreography and spoken dialogue; creative discretion is permitted solely in casting, color palette, and the design of in-world elements not explicitly described in the original text—including those featured exclusively in promotional materials—provided such choices do not conflict with the tone, message, or narrative structure of the source work; these terms are binding, absolute, irrevocable, and entirely non-negotiable.    </p>
    <p>
      These terms are perpetually binding and non-negotiable, surviving beyond my lifetime and enforceable solely by my designated literary estate. This authority remains valid under the most fundamental premise: so long as existence contests or cohabits with nonexistence. Silence, ambiguity, or passive acceptance shall never constitute permission. No portion of these terms shall be construed to imply traceability, jurisdictional fixity, or personal identity. Therefore, the only valid path to contact is through explicit acceptance of the form linked above.
    </p>

    <p>
  Should any violating party depict me—implicitly or explicitly—as barbaric, inferior, defamatory, or otherwise—based on race, background, belief, identity, or any recognizable attribute—such portrayal is to be regarded solely as a reflection of their own projection and bias. It becomes their lantern, not my light—a beacon revealing their framework, not mine. While U.S. law may shield such acts under satire or parody, I reserve the categorical right to designate such works as <strong>nonconfirmative</strong>: devoid of truth, affiliation, or consent. Exceptions apply solely to formal court filings submitted under verified jurisdiction, evidentiary rules, and procedural transparency. The responsibility to verify, validate, and justify any claim lies solely with the accuser and their audience—not the portrayed. Followers of such portrayals do so at their own moral and intellectual risk. It is upon them to weigh distortion against truth; no burden of clarification lies with the subject of the claim.
</p>


    <p>
      <em>What exists is not always shared. What is shared is not always what exists. Public presence is not public property. Laws apply—yours, and mine, whereto may not be where you find me. Many may bear my name; none can own my essense.</em>
