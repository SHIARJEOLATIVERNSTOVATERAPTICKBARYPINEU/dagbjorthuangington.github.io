    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.
    </p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.
    </p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set to myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.

  <h2>Contact / Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
<div class="contact">
<em>Effective Immediately and Indefinitely</em>
<p>
By accessing this website—regardless of intent, method, or point of entry—you hereby unconditionally agree to the following legally binding Terms of Use and Conditional License Agreement. These terms apply globally, without exception, and are considered enforceable under all relevant national and international jurisdictions.
</p><p>
If you do not accept these terms in full, you are required to exit this website immediately and, in any event, no later than two (2) cumulative seconds after reading this sentence. Any continued or repeated access or use of any part of this website beyond that period shall constitute full, informed, and legally binding agreement to all terms outlined herein.
</p><p>
    No attempt at contact, communication, or engagement shall be considered valid, legally actionable, or acknowledged unless such attempt is initiated by a competent and verifiable legal authority possessing active statutory jurisdiction. This must be substantiated by verifiable documentation establishing an unbroken chain of custody in compliance with recognized evidentiary standards. Any claims predicated upon alleged compulsion, purported narrative obligations, or asserted indirect or derivative authority are hereby declared null, void, and without effect. Communications failing to meet these criteria are deemed unsolicited and will be categorically disregarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Invitations extended by media or similar entities shall be recognized as valid only if initiated by nationally recognized authorities or major public figures originating exclusively from politically neutral states. Political neutrality herein excludes individuals or entities with explicit, documented affiliations—formal or informal—to either right-wing or left-wing ideological frameworks, irrespective of their official capacities. A state is deemed ineligible if it fails to demonstrate transparent governance, consistently uphold fundamental human rights, or maintain a documented record free from protectionist or censorial practices. Such practices include, but are not limited to, deportation or exclusion of foreign nationals under the pretense of patriotism, enacted / voted in / allowed tariffs within the last ten tenures as a federal or state worker, and has any soceitcal crisises of turning otherwise unpolitical subjects of discussion into political subjects of discussion. States enacting legislation or policies contravening these principles—and additional requirements outlined herein—are permanently disqualified from eligibility unless such actions are reversed via enforceable, transparent legal measures that explicitly preclude recurrence through loopholes, discretionary abuse, or procedural evasion. Symbolic gestures, legislative repeals without enforcement, or administrative delays shall not constitute reinstatement of eligibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entities actively engaged in armed conflict, subjected to or imposing sanctions, participating in proxy aggression, or possessing documented violations of the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> or <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> within the preceding ten-year period shall be categorically disqualified from eligibility under these Terms and Conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any country, territory, jurisdiction, or entity shall be considered <strong>ineligible</strong> for any form of engagement, collaboration, or correspondence governed by these Terms and Conditions if it maintains, supports, or has a documented historical pattern—whether direct, indirect, or by proxy—of military buildup, arms expansion, or force projection during periods of declared peacetime. This disqualification applies regardless of whether such activities are conducted independently, through occupation, allied presence, or via proxy agreements. Ineligibility also extends to jurisdictions engaged in militarized economic zones, defense-focused industrial subsidies, or habitual mobilizations justified by deterrence or strategic posturing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exceptions to the foregoing disqualifications are made exclusively for jurisdictions meeting all of the following cumulative criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Maintain no standing military forces, do not host foreign military bases or allied forces, and refrain from any covert or overt military cooperation—including during periods of internal instability—unless such cooperation ceased immediately following the removal of leadership regimes found to have willfully violated the principles outlined in the preceding paragraph;
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate internationally recognized political neutrality, exemplified by states such as the Swiss Confederation;
    </li>
    <li>
      Hold memberships exclusively in international or supranational organizations whose founding charters explicitly mandate non-military scopes, such as humanitarian, cultural, or scientific objectives. Such affiliations must not be exploited as conduits for soft influence, associative branding, or diplomatic circumvention of these terms.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any past or present affiliation with militarized entities shall override any non-military affiliations upon involvement—directly, indirectly, or by proxy—in armed conflict, weapons supply, or proxy war engagement. This disqualification includes actions framed as morally justified, preemptive, ideological, retaliatory, or otherwise—such as the Vietnam conflict—where such justifications lack enduring ethical consensus or result in conflicts deemed senseless or disproportionate by post-engagement evaluations. Announcements of war cessation or peace declarations—such as those following early post-9/11 military operations—shall not reinstate eligibility if residual or systemic consequences persist.
  </p>
<p> Any diplomatic, economic, or military coalition, alliance, or collective grouping of states that, through its coordinated economic, military, or political actions, seeks to exert disproportionate influence over global governance, economic systems, or military affairs—particularly in a way that undermines principles of political neutrality, non-interference, or sovereign independence—shall be excluded under this agreement. This includes entities that, despite claiming neutrality or non-militarization, are found to engage in indirect military cooperation, defense-related trade, or strategic political maneuvering that disrupts global peace or democratic self-determination. </p> <p> This exclusion applies to entities or groupings that meet the following criteria: </p> <ul> <li>Form multi-nation economic, military, or political alliances whose actions directly or indirectly influence or control sovereign states or their internal decisions, particularly through soft power tactics such as economic pressure, resource manipulation, or coercive diplomacy;</li> <li>Engage in military cooperation, including arms deals, joint defense agreements, or other security arrangements that extend beyond their own territorial boundaries, effectively supporting or enabling conflicts or geopolitical instability;</li> <li>Collaborate with other states, corporations, or entities in a manner that concentrates power or strategic influence, undermining democratic processes, self-determination, or the principles of equity and mutual respect in international relations;</li> <li>Attempt to circumvent or manipulate neutral international laws, norms, or agreements, including the imposition of economic sanctions, resource monopolization, or influencing international bodies in ways that go against the spirit of fair and impartial governance.</li> </ul> <p> Furthermore, any subsequent formations or new alliances that exhibit the same behaviors—regardless of their name, formal structure, or claimed ideological positions—shall be similarly excluded from engagement under these terms. </p>
  <p>
    Any form of prestige-based infiltration, soft power maneuvering, associative branding, or diplomatic Trojan-horse tactics intended to bypass these Terms and Conditions—whether through joint ventures, celebrity endorsements, honorary designations, or cultural ambassadorships—shall constitute a direct violation of these Terms. Eligibility requires not only formal nonalignment but also demonstrable absence of intent, infrastructure, or proxy mechanisms capable of undermining these terms through implication, association, or covert influence. Consequently, any attempt to gain an invitation from a state, provincial, supranational, or federal body, either on a piece of land surrounded by a disqualified country or located within the territory of a disqualified country, shall invalidate the inclusion of such a scenario. This includes scenarios where I may be invited to space, sea, or underground environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Governance structures must exhibit peaceful power transitions, maintain independent judiciaries, resolve territorial disputes amicably, and support unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchanges without censorship or undue interference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Physical meetings shall occur exclusively in secure, controlled environments that prohibit flash photography, drone operation, visible aircraft, weapons possession, and unauthorized gatherings. Representatives attending such meetings must originate from jurisdictions fully compliant with all preceding criteria.
  </p>
  <p>
  Sponsorships and company visits are categorically disqualified if the entity is—currently or within the past several fiscal years after a primary niche shift—affiliated with any of the following. Terms are interpreted in accordance with all applicable jurisdictions, from national to local levels:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intrusive or deceptive advertising practices, including but not limited to autoplay media or fake skip buttons;</li>
  <li>Misleading product labeling, false representation, or deceptive marketing tactics;</li>
  <li>Industries engaged in alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, armaments, or sex work platforms;</li>
  <li>Entities implicated in scandals, fraud, harassment, or associations with known bad actors;</li>
  <li>Use of microtransactions without a lifetime or one-time payment alternative;</li>
  <li>Recurring payment models unaffordable at the lowest legal wage within hyperinflated economies;</li>
  <li>Advertising formats that are stacked, unskippable, or so excessive they necessitate the use of ad blockers;</li>
  <li>Provision of low-value goods or services yielding disproportionate profits with minimal genuine customer benefit;</li>
  <li>Entities promoting privacy while having publicly exposed protected user data at least once;</li>
  <li>Production of shovelware or similarly defined low-effort products;</li>
  <li>Any rebranding, niche-shifting, or shell company restructuring intended to circumvent these disqualifiers;</li>
  <li>
    Entities whose business model relies on excessive or unnecessary profit margins at the direct expense of consumer welfare—via exploitative pricing, deceptive bundling, disaster profiteering, or artificial scarcity. The allowable net profit for such entities shall not exceed <strong>twice</strong> their total operating costs for the most recent fiscal year, with <strong>50%</strong> of that profit reinvested into sustainable operations and the remainder reserved for contingencies or reinvestment.
    <br><em>Operating costs</em> are defined as all expenses necessary to run the business, including post-investor distributions, dividends, and other investor-related outflows.
    <br>Evidence of underreporting, overreporting, or non-audited estimations shall trigger <strong>personal liability</strong>, not that of the partnership.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Any entity—whether a business corporation, non-governmental organization (NGO), non-profit with commercial activities, or other revenue-generating body—seeking partnership, sponsorship, or collaboration must demonstrate full and verifiable compliance with the above requirements, regardless of its tax classification, legal structure, or declared mission. Verification requires submission of financial documentation adhering to internationally recognized standards, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Publicly available annual reports;</li>
  <li>Audited financial statements;</li>
  <li>Regulatory filings to relevant oversight bodies in all jurisdictions of operation;</li>
  <li>Or equivalent disclosures under GAAP, IFRS, or jurisdictionally mandated accounting standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Multinational entities must submit consolidated financials covering all subsidiaries, branches, and cross-border operations. Fragmentation or selective reporting designed to obscure true profitability will result in automatic disqualification.
</p>
<p>
  Any falsification, evasion, or material omission of required disclosures will result in immediate liability, cancellation of any agreements, and permanent exclusion from future eligibility under these terms. The burden of proof rests solely with the entity.
</p>
<p>
    Education, health, and other unmentioned institutions who want to contact me in any way must likewise be bound by ethics and law, wherein they shall not have a recent 10-year history of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initiating, encouraging, or spreading medical, historical, scientific, or legal disinformation/misinformation;</li>
    <li>Any ban-listed items off of the sponsorships and company visits list (implied included);</li>
    <li>Demonstrated largely black hat hacking, distribution of malware, or otherwise (including those who rented even a chair or a desk to one bad actor in this list item);</li>
    <li>Dropping a rank or multiple ranks among their state/province education systems regarding not the sports, but the academic competencies to achieve at least a CTE level;</li>
    <li>Having a history of medical or legal malpractice;</li>
    <li>One incident of any terrorism (mainly a crime of which fear is instilled upon innocence) committed by one of their members.</li>
</ul>
  <p>Individual creators, sole proprietors, or unincorporated merch sellers are presumed exempt from financial disclosure obligations under these terms unless operating under a formal business entity structure or receiving third-party brand sponsorship</p>
  <p>
    Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain ethical conduct, respect all personal and professional boundaries, and possess verified fluency in the English language. Excessive vulgarity, presumptive tone, invasive behavior, or breach of conduct standards shall result in permanent blacklisting.
  </p>
  <h3>Consent, Usage &amp; Likeness</h3>
  <p>
    Filming, recording, or content creation featuring me as the primary subject or focal point requires prior explicit written consent obtained via the designated form accessible 
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any content in which I appear—granted only under explicit, documented, and prior consent—must comply with the following mandatory safeguards: all visual frames featuring my image must apply a localized Gaussian blur mask fully encompassing my entire figure. The resolution of this mask must be no less than the diagonal pixel count of the largest commercially available device anticipated in the distribution, publication, or playback chain. All accompanying audio tracks must be irreversibly modified to obscure my natural tone, pitch, cadence, and frequency profile. Furthermore, each visual frame must be post-processed—whether after live stream or recorded production—using robust AI poisoning techniques explicitly designed to render the content unsuitable for training datasets, machine learning inference, or generative model synthesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    At no point—whether prior to release, during recording, or post-release—may the content creator disclose any information beyond acknowledgment of collaboration and the fact of meeting me. Any mention or implication of knowledge regarding my appearance, scent, voice, or any biometric identifiers is strictly prohibited. These conditions serve as preemptive safeguards against misuse by malicious actors irrespective of jurisdiction, intent, or affiliation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unauthorized publication or dissemination of my unaltered facial likeness, voice, or biometric identifiers by any external party constitutes a direct and actionable violation of these Terms and Conditions. Such breaches will trigger immediate and automatic eternal blacklisting of the individual and all affiliated parties. At my sole discretion, a formal takedown request may be issued, requiring full compliance without delay or objection. Continued possession or distribution of infringing material after notice shall constitute willful infringement, potentially provoking legal action across all relevant jurisdictions and resulting in permanent disqualification from future collaborations regardless of subsequent forgiveness requests. This includes stalking of any form.
  </p>
  <p>
    Defamatory, racialized, dehumanizing, or falsely consenting portrayals—regardless of format—are the sole responsibility of their creators. While satire and parody protections under applicable law are recognized, such content may still be publicly declared unauthorized and unendorsed by me. Legal tolerance does not imply ethical alignment. All creators assume full accountability for reputational, social, and legal consequences arising therefrom.
  </p>
  <p>
    Incidental appearances require no prior consent unless the footage is deliberately reframed to present me as a primary secondary, or one of the many subjects of focus. All live stream collaborations must comply fully with the conditions outlined herein and related provisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My likeness, name, voice, habits, or creative works may not be used for AI training, derivative media, sublicensing, or transfer without explicit prior written consent. Subsequently, the violation of this paragraph and the ones above is not a ticket to add to the pressure of which may be called an push for an official face or voice reveal, but if so, the viewers and hosts have to consent to seeing me with identity masked for the rest of my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Agreements or media created under coercion, surveillance, phishing, impersonation, or any form of undue influence are null, void, and unenforceable both ethically and legally. Unauthorized disclosures under such circumstances are invalid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Violations render offending works non-conformative, inadmissible, and ethically void within the public record. I am under no obligation to acknowledge, respond to, or validate such portrayals. Their credibility is subject to public scrutiny and the conscience of creators, with the presumption that audiences apply critical judgment. Unless I have committed the alleged acts as defined under applicable law, such portrayals shall be considered self-discrediting and not legitimate representations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any adaptations require formal written contracts. Intellectual property rights remain solely mine and are non-transferable for the full legal copyright term commencing at the latest publications featuring me as subject; extendable only in terms pertaining to literary legacy of my works and my name.
  </p>
  <p>
    During all stages of drafting, editing, promotion, and distribution period (including but not limited to: screenings, consumers buying, others making a review of the product / products), original production staff must remain unchanged. Any death, resignation, transfer, or reassignment—except voluntary retirement at industry-standard age without coercion—shall result in project termination and restart; any continuation to thereof is at the peril of voiding any further interaction with the producers, staff, and creators involved or featured in such projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI may be employed solely as a creative support tool under direct human supervision. The replacement of human creators by AI is strictly prohibited unless a genuine Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) possessing full creative autonomy is demonstrably achieved. This threshold requires the AI to generate content with consistent frame-to-frame coherence, adhering to logical constraints in object placement, color accuracy, and sound design.
</p>
<p>
    AI use is further limited to photorealistic post-production enhancements that meet or exceed the quality standards set by the previous year's highest award recipients in the most prestigious categories relevant to the adaptation. For projects spanning multiple years, the applicable standard is the highest award at the time of production. The sole exception to these restrictions is a demonstrably true AGI capable of fully autonomous creative acts. 
</p><p>All authorized promotional materials under these terms shall exclude plot details and character outcomes. All authorized adaptations must remain textually faithful, permitting only minimal interpretive latitude where the source material is ambiguous or unspecified, such as in undefined scenes or chapters within standalone works or series; this does not thus include details to any eleements in the book that are filled in by later chapters.
</p>
  <p>
  Ninety-nine percent (99%) of all net profits derived from the creation, publication, distribution, adaptation, or commercialization of any third-party work incorporating my original intellectual property—including but not limited to characters, items, settings, or narrative constructs as defined in these Terms and Conditions—shall be payable to me in perpetuity of copyright of the latest works.
</p>
<p>
  In the event such third-party works incur financial loss, those losses shall be treated as liquidated damages at the same ninety-nine percent (99%) rate, payable in equal installments every forty-six (46) calendar days beginning from the first full calendar year following initial public release.
</p>
<p>
  Any third-party creation, distribution, sale, or adaptation of merchandise, media, or derivative works based on my intellectual property requires express written authorization and shall remain subject to the same compensation terms stated above, regardless of medium, platform, or scale of production.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this compensation obligation shall not apply to any publishing or distribution platform—such as Draft2Digital or equivalent services—that I have personally and explicitly engaged under my sole discretion for the limited purpose of publishing or facilitating access to my original works. These platforms are recognized strictly as intermediaries and shall hold no derivative, adaptive, or commercial rights beyond those contractually necessary to perform their distribution functions.
</p>
<p>
  This exception does not extend to any third party who independently uses the same or similar platforms or distribution programs without my explicit authorization; such parties remain fully subject to all compensation obligations and restrictions set forth herein.
</p>
<p>
The profitability or lack thereof—including commercial failure or critical success—shall have no bearing on the enforceability of this compensation clause. Works—whether from collaborations, partnerships, or individual efforts—archived solely for historical preservation are exempt from commercial use, royalties, and damage claims. Such archived works shall be permanently closed and remain untouched indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
Any human, machine, or program aware—directly or through any chain of language translations—of the nature and terms of this clause is strictly prohibited from accessing, modifying, or otherwise “touching” the archived works. Such contact shall be treated as a violation equivalent to the unauthorized handling of protected historic artifacts. This prohibition applies universally, regardless of the passage of time or technological means used to access the archive.
</p>
<p>
  For the avoidance of doubt, all references to adaptations, third-party works, derivative works, or comparable terms shall include any creation—regardless of medium or format—that mimics, incorporates, reinterprets, or is demonstrably based upon any character, item, structure, or concept originating from my original works. This inclusion applies irrespective of whether such elements have been modified, reordered, renamed, or embedded within a new narrative or creative context, provided that the origin remains reasonably identifiable.
</p>
<p>
  This provision does not extend to uses that fall squarely within protected categories of parody or satire as expressly defined under applicable law, specifically when such use is clearly transformative and intended for commentary, criticism, or expressive ridicule. Mere stylistic mimicry, tonal borrowing, or narrative recontextualization without such purpose shall not qualify for this exception.
</p>
<p>
Any third party who incorporates, adapts, replicates, references, emulates, or derives from the protected elements of this intellectual property—whether directly, indirectly, manually, through automation, or via substantial similarity—without prior, explicit, and written authorization from the rights holder, shall be unconditionally required, for the full remaining duration of all applicable intellectual property protections (including but not limited to copyright, moral rights, and sui generis database rights), to provide clear, visible, and unambiguous attribution to the original creator, using the designated pen name, in all publicly accessible versions, formats, or distributions of the resulting or affected work.
</p>

<p>
This obligation applies universally and without exception to any third party or affiliated entity that meets one or more of the following criteria:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Monetizes or intends to monetize the resulting work or any derivative thereof—either directly or indirectly—including but not limited to: retail sales, advertising, donations (explicit or implicit, such as “support future projects”), subscriptions, paywalled access, merchandising, tokenization, crowdfunding, or any other form of financial compensation reasonably related to the use, presence, or development of the protected material.
  </li>
  <li>
    Delegates, proxies, or automates the act of creation to another human, legal entity, software system, or artificial agent (including but not limited to AI models, machine learning tools, freelancers, subcontractors, or employees), including scenarios where labor is distributed among multiple individuals or teams contributing to the same end product. This constitutes indirect use or derivative production regardless of authorial intent or awareness.
  </li>
  <li>
    Has, manages, or anticipates a combined staff and audience count exceeding three (3) individuals. "Staff" includes anyone involved—formally or informally, paid or unpaid—in the creation, development, management, promotion, or distribution of the work. "Audience" includes but is not limited to: readers, followers, subscribers, viewers, testers, backers, or end users engaging with the material in any way.
  </li>

<p>
Failure to comply with this attribution requirement shall result in permanent and irrevocable disqualification from any current or future collaboration, licensing, or engagement opportunities with the rights holder. Infringing parties may additionally be subject, at the sole discretion of the rights holder, to immediate enforcement actions including but not limited to: takedown notices under national or international intellectual property regimes (e.g., DMCA, EUCD), cease-and-desist orders, public revocation notices, and formal civil or criminal legal proceedings under applicable jurisdiction(s) for infringement, misappropriation, or unjust enrichment.
</p>
<p>
Ignorance of any terms contained within this Terms and Conditions (T&C) section—whether integrated into a webpage or presented as a standalone page—failure to read this notice, or attempts to circumvent these terms through technical or semantic means shall not constitute a valid defense. Continued access, use, or creation of derivative works following presentation of this notice constitutes affirmative, informed, and legally binding acceptance of all terms herein.
</p>
<p>
Any attempt to circumvent, obscure, or dilute the required attribution—whether through indirect publication, pseudonymous dissemination, intermediary proxy entities, or other means—shall be treated as a material breach and subject to the same remedies.
</p>
  <p>
All parties are considered blacklisted by default unless explicitly whitelisted via completion of the designated consent form. My emailed reply to the submitted address constitutes confirmation of consent. Any denial may redirect correspondents to these Terms and Conditions within such replies. Contact attempts without a completed form, where stated reasons materially differ from actual conduct, or remain vague shall be deemed invalid.
</p>
<p>
Failure to respond shall not be construed as consent. Any attempt to circumvent these Terms and Conditions—including falsification or doctoring of evidence to simulate consent—will result in permanent refusal of future contact form submissions by the violator and may prompt legal action.
</p>
<p>
If these Terms are deemed onerous, I reserve sole discretion to streamline procedural requirements for a limited number of known creators. This, however, does not constitute exemption from any provision herein. Enforcement follows a strict policy: any substantiated violation, evidenced by preexisting content breaching these Terms, shall lead to immediate disqualification from further collaboration until a public apology is issued—one from which I am explicitly excluded.
</p>
  <p>Whitelist status granted to any party is strictly limited to the specific purpose and intent declared at the time of consent. Any attempt to extend, alter, or repurpose the granted status without explicit, prior written approval constitutes a material breach of these Terms and Conditions. Upon such breach, whitelist status will be immediately revoked and the party automatically placed back on the default blacklist. No exceptions or grace periods apply.</p>
  <p>
  These Terms and Conditions are binding both during my lifetime and posthumously, and shall be enforceable by my designated literary estate. In the absence of an established estate, enforcement rights shall transfer to my appointed executors or trustees. However, any executor or trustee—whether individual or institutional—who, through physical, verbal, written, or digital actions, publicly or privately discredits, undermines, or otherwise represents these Terms and Conditions in a disparaging or oppositional manner, regardless of intent or justification, shall be deemed illegitimate, disavowed, and permanently stripped of all associated rights, authority, and affiliation. In such cases, they must either: (a) immediately and transparently appoint a qualified successor—individual or organization—with a minimum ten-year record of reputable conduct and public credibility, or (b) transfer responsibility to a surviving relative or institution demonstrably capable of upholding the original intent of these Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Should all aforementioned designations—whether estate, executor, trustee, or appointed successor—fail, become inoperative, or be rendered illegitimate, all rights, licenses, and obligations governed by these Terms and Conditions shall immediately and automatically revert to a default <strong>“all-rights-reserved”</strong> status. This default shall endure for the maximum period permitted under the longest-standing national copyright term recognized by international law, specifically as upheld by the geographically nearest sovereign country that: (1) is recognized by no fewer than three major intergovernmental organizations, and (2) has neither enacted nor proposed any legislation restricting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or comparable civil liberties within the ten years preceding said reversion.
</p>
<p>
  This default state is strictly irrevocable and shall remain in effect unless—and only if—a legitimate and demonstrably qualified successor emerges who fully upholds and executes all provisions of these Terms and Conditions in unbroken continuity. Such emergence must occur prior to the expiration of the global maximum term defined above; otherwise, the default shall remain permanently binding and nontransferable.
</p>
<p>
  Trustees or executors who designate time capsules as successors must also name a secondary, sentient, non-time-capsule successor capable of immediately continuing these terms, and not to be considered an IP split or cross-lisencing as long as the secondary is one of the chooser's ally that meets all applicable restrictions and expectations applied implicitly and explicitly by this document. All amendments to such agreements in this scenario and the one involving transferrence to another entity of sentience must be formally notarized and signed in duplicate by both the undersigned party and the designated recipient. No presumed intent or implied agreement shall be recognized under any circumstances.
</p>
  <p>The intellectual property (IP) developed by this entity, including all associated patents, trademarks, copyrights, tangible, and other intangible assets, shall remain non-transferable. No IP shall be sold, licensed, sublicensed, or assigned to third parties except as expressly permitted in writing under this agreement and by the tangible evidence by the entity. Attempts to bypass or obscure this requirement through IP-related financial arrangements will result in immediate liability and instant inelegibility.</p>
  <p>Any financial arrangement, structuring, or transfer involving the entity’s intellectual property, including but not limited to cross-licensing agreements, IP splits, or assignments, even if not in direct violation of legal frameworks, that could be perceived as an attempt to circumvent the provisions outlined herein, will be considered in violation and subject to the consequences of immediate liability and ineligibility.</p>
<p>In the event of any dispute arising from the enforcement, interpretation, or breach of this agreement, including but not limited to matters involving intellectual property or its transfer, the parties agree that such dispute shall be resolved exclusively through a bench trial. The trial shall be held in the jurisdiction of my place of residence at the time of the dispute, and shall be presided over by a judge with expertise in intellectual property law or commercial contracts. Any request for a jury trial or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods shall be deemed invalid and immediately dismissed.
  </p>
  <p>The parties agree that the trial shall not exceed 90 days in duration. Should the trial last longer than this period, it shall be deemed void and of no legal effect. Furthermore, any party acting in bad faith as the accuser during the proceedings may be subject to additional penalties, including but not limited to reimbursement of legal fees, damages, or any further actions deemed necessary by the court.</p>
