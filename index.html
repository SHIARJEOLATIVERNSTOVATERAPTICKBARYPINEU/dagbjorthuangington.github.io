    <h1>Q. Dagbjort Huangington</h1>
    <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.</p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.</p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.</p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.</p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p>
      The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="contact-terms">
  <h2>Contact / Terms & Conditions</h2>
<div class="contact">
  <p>
    By accessing this page, contacting me, referencing my works, or engaging in any communication, you unconditionally agree to all terms stated herein. These terms are legally binding, irrevocable, non-negotiable, and enforceable under all applicable laws and jurisdictions. Non-compliance constitutes breach of contract and infringement of intellectual property rights.
  </p>

  <p>
    No contact attempt shall be valid or actionable unless initiated by a competent, verifiable legal authority under active statutory jurisdiction, supported by verifiable documentation with a full chain of custody. Claims of compulsion, narrative obligation, or indirect authority are null and void. Unqualified communications are unsolicited and will be disregarded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Media invitations are only recognized if initiated by nationally recognized authorities or major public figures from politically neutral states demonstrating adherence to transparency, human rights, and the absence of protectionist or censorial practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Entities engaged in active conflict, sanctions, proxy aggression, or with documented violations of the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> or <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> within the past decade are disqualified.
  </p>

  <p>
    Governance must exhibit peaceful power transitions, independent judiciary, resolution of territorial disputes, and support for unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchange.
  </p>

  <p>
    Physical meetings require secure, controlled environments prohibiting flash photography, drones, visible aircraft, weapons, and unauthorized gatherings. Representatives must be from fully compliant jurisdictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sponsorships and company visits are disqualified if affiliated, currently or within the last fiscal season, with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intrusive or deceptive advertising (e.g., autoplay, fake skip buttons)</li>
    <li>Misleading product labeling or representation</li>
    <li>Industries such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, or sex work platforms</li>
    <li>Entities involved in scandals, fraud, harassment, or associated with known bad actors</li>
    <li>Use of microtransactions without lifetime one-time payment alternatives</li>
    <li>Recurring payment plans unaffordable at the lowest legal wage in hyperinflated economies</li>
    <li>Stacked, unskippable, or excessive advertisements requiring ad blockers</li>
    <li>Low-value goods or services with disproportionate profits and minimal authentic customer satisfaction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain ethical conduct, respect boundaries, and possess English fluency; excessive vulgarity, presumptive tone, or invasive conduct results in permanent blacklisting.
  </p>

  <h3>Consent, Usage & Likeness</h3>

  <p>
    Filming, recording, or content creation featuring me as subject or focus requires prior explicit written consent via the designated form linked
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Approved content must apply Gaussian blur no less than the diagonal pixel count of the largest viewing device (minimum 1920 pixels for HD) and irreversibly alter audio to mask natural tone and frequency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incidental appearances require no consent unless deliberately reframed to make me a primary or secondary focus. Live streaming collaborations involving me are strictly prohibited.
  </p>

  <p>
    My likeness, name, voice, or creative works may not be used for AI training, derivative media, sublicensing, or transfer without explicit written consent.
  </p>

  <p>
    Agreements or media created under coercion, surveillance, phishing, impersonation, or undue influence are null and void. Unauthorized disclosures are invalid ethically and legally.
  </p>

  <p>
    Violations render offending works nonconfirmative, inadmissible, and ethically void. I am under no obligation to respond or validate such portrayals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adaptations require formal written contracts. Intellectual property rights remain solely mine and non-transferable for the full legal copyright term from first publication.
  </p>

  <p>
    During drafting, editing, promotion, and screening, all original production staff must remain unchanged. Any death, resignation, transfer, or reassignment (except voluntary retirement at industry-standard age without coercion) requires project termination and restart.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI may only be used as a creative support tool under direct human oversight. AI replacement of creators is prohibited unless genuine AGI with full creative autonomy is achieved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ninety-nine percent (99%) of net profits are payable to me in perpetuity, with losses treated as liquidated damages at the same rate, payable quarterly from the first release year.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI use is restricted to photorealistic post-production enhancements meeting or exceeding <em>Avatar</em> (2009) standards. Promotional materials must exclude plot specifics and character outcomes. Adaptations must remain textually faithful with minimal interpretive latitude.
  </p>

  <p>
    All parties are blacklisted unless explicitly whitelisted via completion of the designated form. My emailed reply to the submitted address constitutes confirmation of consent; denial may redirect to these Terms & Conditions in such emailed replies. Whitelist status is revocable without notice. Contact attempts without form completion are invalid, as are cases where the stated reason and intent on the form materially differ from actual conduct or are too vague.
  </p>

  <p>
    Absence of response does not imply consent. Attempts to circumvent these terms will result in permanent silence and potential legal action.
  </p>

  <p>
    These terms are binding during my lifetime and posthumously, enforceable by my designated literary estate in which if there's none, lasts as long as copyright. Silence or passive conduct does not imply acceptance. Terms apply universally across all jurisdictions and contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Defamatory, racialized, dehumanizing, or falsely consenting portrayals are the sole responsibility of their creators. Satire and parody protections are recognized, but I reserve the right to declare such content unauthorized and unendorsed.
  </p>
  <p>
    All legal disputes naming me as the accused—whether arising after any interaction initiated via form submission, or relating to this individual under the pen name associated with the author logo—must be filed exclusively in verified jurisdictions and represented by duly licensed, independent counsel in ethical standing. Only formal bench trials are permitted; arbitration, mediation, and alternative dispute mechanisms are expressly excluded. I bear no obligation to engage with claims rooted in distortion, fabrication, speculative narrative, or demonstrable bad faith. I thus in such cases, stand valid to be charged in the immediate futures of each case with perjury.
  </p>
  <p>
    If wrongfully accused, harmed, or killed—including in disputed or no-man’s-land territories—investigations shall be at least expected to involve all competent authorities local to the event and all applicable entitled by hierarchy or law in which m,ust be superiors to the competent authorities. This includes nearest nations, last recorded vehicle docking or landing sites, manufacture and registration countries, all online and private communications (digital or physical) of suspects, authorities presiding over areas of known residences and travel histories of those suspects, medical and psychological records, and relevant familial and generational associations. This clause mandates comprehensive, cooperative inquiry without presumption of guilt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Media and platforms possessing related materials must impose an immediate moratorium on dissemination pending investigation. Premature or speculative reporting is a violation and grounds for permanent non-engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Public presence confers no entitlement. Visibility does not equal accessibility. Jurisdiction does not entail nearness. A name does not constitute identity.</em>
