    <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.</p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.</p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.</p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.</p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p>
      The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact / Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <div class="contact">
      <p>Media invitations—present or future—will only be acknowledged if initiated by a recognized authority or major public figure and are subject to strict, hierarchical evaluation. National-level representatives must originate from states that demonstrate strict political neutrality: no protectionist economics, no discriminatory legal shields, and no sub-national or supra-national structures used to evade public health or accountability standards. Countries must not be currently engaged in internal or external armed conflict, civil unrest, or martial law, and must have no record within the last decade of initiating or supporting warfare or proxy conflicts. Human rights criteria require full adherence to conventions like the UDHR and ICCPR; censorship, persecution of journalists or creatives, and punishment based on identity, expression, or appearance are disqualifying. Governance must include legitimate, peaceful transitions of power with judicial independence and no pattern of regressions post-scrutiny. Internationally, qualifying states must be free of sanctions, territorial disputes, and open investigations for crimes against humanity. The civic environment must support unrestricted cultural, academic, and media exchange, with no ideological screening or propaganda co-opting. Meetings must guarantee a no-flash, no-drone, no-visible-aircraft, no-weapons, no-mobbing safety zone. Supranational leaders must represent only compliant member states and never seek to use my participation to legitimize non-compliant ones. Regional and municipal leaders must govern conflict-free zones, uphold full legal protections for expressive freedom, reject extremism or separatism, and fully meet all applicable higher-tier criteria. Company leaders are disqualified if affiliated—currently or within the last fiscal season—with intrusive advertising (e.g., RAID-style repetition), deceptive product labeling (e.g., disguised sugars or missing percentages), or certain industries including but not limited to alcohol, tobacco, fast food, gambling, or prostitution. Associations with recent scandals, fraud, harassment, or facility-sharing with bad actors also result in disqualification. All prospective contacts—journalists, podcasters, creators—must exhibit a clean ethical record, no history of violating individual dignity, and consistent professional conduct. Acceptable light swearing is permitted; excessive vulgarity, unsolicited creative offers, presumptive tone, or invasive behavior (e.g., flashes, sudden lighting) may result in permanent blacklist. English fluency is mandatory (ESL or equivalent completed); Mandarin conversational ability is optional but preferred. Prior familiarity may allow case-by-case leniency but does not guarantee engagement.</p>
<p>Filming me with intent—where I appear as subject, focal point, or narrator—requires both verbal and written consent, and is subject to visual distortion using a Gaussian blur equal to the diagonal pixel count of your or your client’s largest screen, as well as voice modification in all forms of storage or transmission. Incidental appearances (e.g., background pass-through) require no consent unless focus is shifted post-capture via editing, framing, or commentary. Live streaming or real-time broadcasting is strictly prohibited. Influencers and independent content creators are bound by these same terms, regardless of follower count or platform. My likeness, voice, or writing may not be synthesized, simulated, trained into AI, or used as a generative model prompt in any capacity. Public presence does not imply creative availability. No reinterpretation, satire, commentary, reaction media, or derivative use of my appearance, words, or works may be made without direct approval. No sublicensing, redistribution, or third-party transfer of footage or derivative material is authorized unless renegotiated case-by-case. All agreements are void if obtained under surveillance, constraint, detention, or legal coercion. These terms remain binding after my death; rights transfer solely to my designated literary estate. Silence, absence, or ambiguity does not imply relinquishment. The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists. Above all else, every law of your jurisdiction applies—as does mine, whereto may not be where you find me.</p>
