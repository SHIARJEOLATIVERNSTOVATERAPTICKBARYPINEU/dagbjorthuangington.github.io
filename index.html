    <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.
    </p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.
    </p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.

    <p>
      The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists.

  <h2>Contact / Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
<div class="contact">
  <p>
    By accessing this webpage, referencing any of my authored works in any form, or engaging in any form of direct or indirect communication with me or my representatives, you hereby unconditionally agree to all terms explicitly stated within this document. These terms are deemed legally binding upon all parties involved, irrevocable without mutual written agreement, non-negotiable under any circumstances, and enforceable according to all applicable national, international, and supranational laws and jurisdictions governing such interactions. Any failure to comply with these terms constitutes a breach of contract and an infringement upon my intellectual property rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    No attempt at contact, communication, or engagement shall be considered valid, legally actionable, or acknowledged unless such attempt is initiated by a competent and verifiable legal authority possessing active statutory jurisdiction. This must be substantiated by verifiable documentation establishing an unbroken chain of custody in compliance with recognized evidentiary standards. Any claims predicated upon alleged compulsion, purported narrative obligations, or asserted indirect or derivative authority are hereby declared null, void, and without effect. Communications failing to meet these criteria are deemed unsolicited and will be categorically disregarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Invitations extended by media or similar entities shall be recognized as valid only if initiated by nationally recognized authorities or major public figures originating exclusively from politically neutral states. Political neutrality herein excludes individuals or entities with explicit, documented affiliations—formal or informal—to either right-wing or left-wing ideological frameworks, irrespective of their official capacities. A state is deemed ineligible if it fails to demonstrate transparent governance, consistently uphold fundamental human rights, or maintain a documented record free from protectionist or censorial practices. Such practices include, but are not limited to, deportation or exclusion of foreign nationals under the pretense of patriotism, enacted / voted in / allowed tariffs within the last ten tenures as a federal or state worker, and has any soceitcal crisises of turning otherwise unpolitical subjects of discussion into political subjects of discussion. States enacting legislation or policies contravening these principles—and additional requirements outlined herein—are permanently disqualified from eligibility unless such actions are reversed via enforceable, transparent legal measures that explicitly preclude recurrence through loopholes, discretionary abuse, or procedural evasion. Symbolic gestures, legislative repeals without enforcement, or administrative delays shall not constitute reinstatement of eligibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entities actively engaged in armed conflict, subjected to or imposing sanctions, participating in proxy aggression, or possessing documented violations of the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> or <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> within the preceding ten-year period shall be categorically disqualified from eligibility under these Terms and Conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any country, territory, jurisdiction, or entity shall be considered <strong>ineligible</strong> for any form of engagement, collaboration, or correspondence governed by these Terms and Conditions if it maintains, supports, or has a documented historical pattern—whether direct, indirect, or by proxy—of military buildup, arms expansion, or force projection during periods of declared peacetime. This disqualification applies regardless of whether such activities are conducted independently, through occupation, allied presence, or via proxy agreements. Ineligibility also extends to jurisdictions engaged in militarized economic zones, defense-focused industrial subsidies, or habitual mobilizations justified by deterrence or strategic posturing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exceptions to the foregoing disqualifications are made exclusively for jurisdictions meeting all of the following cumulative criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Maintain no standing military forces, do not host foreign military bases or allied forces, and refrain from any covert or overt military cooperation—including during periods of internal instability—unless such cooperation ceased immediately following the removal of leadership regimes found to have willfully violated the principles outlined in the preceding paragraph;
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate internationally recognized political neutrality, exemplified by states such as the Swiss Confederation;
    </li>
    <li>
      Hold memberships exclusively in international or supranational organizations whose founding charters explicitly mandate non-military scopes, such as humanitarian, cultural, or scientific objectives. Such affiliations must not be exploited as conduits for soft influence, associative branding, or diplomatic circumvention of these terms.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any past or present affiliation with militarized entities shall override any non-military affiliations upon involvement—directly, indirectly, or by proxy—in armed conflict, weapons supply, or proxy war engagement. This disqualification includes actions framed as morally justified, preemptive, ideological, retaliatory, or otherwise—such as the Vietnam conflict—where such justifications lack enduring ethical consensus or result in conflicts deemed senseless or disproportionate by post-engagement evaluations. Announcements of war cessation or peace declarations—such as those following early post-9/11 military operations—shall not reinstate eligibility if residual or systemic consequences persist.
  </p>
<p> Any diplomatic, economic, or military coalition, alliance, or collective grouping of states that, through its **coordinated economic**, **military**, or **political actions**, seeks to exert disproportionate influence over global governance, economic systems, or military affairs—particularly in a way that undermines principles of **political neutrality**, **non-interference**, or **sovereign independence**—shall be excluded under this agreement. This includes entities that, despite claiming neutrality or non-militarization, are found to engage in **indirect military cooperation**, **defense-related trade**, or **strategic political maneuvering** that disrupts global peace or democratic self-determination. </p> <p> This exclusion applies to entities or groupings that meet the following criteria: </p> <ul> <li>Form multi-nation **economic, military, or political alliances** whose actions directly or indirectly influence or control sovereign states or their internal decisions, particularly through **soft power tactics** such as economic pressure, resource manipulation, or coercive diplomacy;</li> <li>Engage in **military cooperation**, including arms deals, joint defense agreements, or other security arrangements that extend beyond their own territorial boundaries, effectively supporting or enabling conflicts or geopolitical instability;</li> <li>Collaborate with other states, corporations, or entities in a manner that **concentrates power** or **strategic influence**, undermining democratic processes, self-determination, or the principles of equity and mutual respect in international relations;</li> <li>Attempt to **circumvent or manipulate** neutral international laws, norms, or agreements, including the imposition of economic sanctions, resource monopolization, or influencing international bodies in ways that go against the spirit of fair and impartial governance.</li> </ul> <p> Furthermore, any **subsequent formations** or **new alliances** that exhibit the same behaviors—regardless of their name, formal structure, or claimed ideological positions—shall be similarly excluded from engagement under these terms. </p>
  <p>
    Any form of prestige-based infiltration, soft power maneuvering, associative branding, or diplomatic Trojan-horse tactics intended to bypass these Terms and Conditions—whether through joint ventures, celebrity endorsements, honorary designations, or cultural ambassadorships—shall constitute a direct violation of these Terms. Eligibility requires not only formal nonalignment but also demonstrable absence of intent, infrastructure, or proxy mechanisms capable of undermining these terms through implication, association, or covert influence. Consequently, any attempt to gain an invitation from a state, provincial, supranational, or federal body, either on a piece of land surrounded by a disqualified country or located within the territory of a disqualified country, shall invalidate the inclusion of such a scenario. This includes scenarios where I may be invited to space, sea, or underground environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Governance structures must exhibit peaceful power transitions, maintain independent judiciaries, resolve territorial disputes amicably, and support unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchanges without censorship or undue interference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Physical meetings shall occur exclusively in secure, controlled environments that prohibit flash photography, drone operation, visible aircraft, weapons possession, and unauthorized gatherings. Representatives attending such meetings must originate from jurisdictions fully compliant with all preceding criteria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sponsorships and company visits are categorically disqualified if affiliated—currently or within the last several fiscal years after main niche change—with any of the following in which terms are defined with all levels of applicable jurisdictions' (nation to neighborhood) definitions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intrusive or deceptive advertising practices, including but not limited to autoplay media or fake skip buttons;</li>
    <li>Misleading product labeling, false representation, or deceptive marketing;</li>
    <li>Industries involved in but not limited to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, armaments, or sex work platforms;</li>
    <li>Entities implicated in scandals, fraud, harassment, or association with known bad actors;</li>
    <li>Use of microtransactions lacking lifetime, one-time payment alternatives;</li>
    <li>Recurring payment schemes unaffordable at the lowest legal wage within hyperinflated economies;</li>
    <li>Advertising formats that are stacked, unskippable, or excessive to the point of requiring ad blockers;</li>
    <li>Provision of low-value goods or services that generate disproportionate profits with minimal authentic customer satisfaction;</li>
    <li>Those notorious for preaching user privacy but who have even once exposed supposedly protected private data to the public;</li>
    <li>Those producing shovelware and other products in similar terms;</li>
    <li>Those having any amount of changing niches just to avoid these deterrents listed in the terms (includes shell companies);</li>
<li>Entities whose business model involves generating excessive, unnecessary profits at the direct expense of their consumers' welfare or needs, particularly through exploitative pricing, deceptive bundling, persistent disaster pricing, or creating artificial scarcity; the maximum allowable profit for such entities is defined as no more than <strong>twice</strong> their operating costs in the previous fiscal year, with <strong>half of that profit</strong> reinvested back into the company for sustainable growth, and the other half set aside for future contingencies or investments. Any evidence of underreporting, over-reporting, or estimated reporting these figures will result in <strong>your own liability</strong>, not that of the partnership. <em>Operating costs are defined as the total expenditures required to run the business, including post-investor distribution, dividends, and any other investor-related financial outflows</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Education, health, and other unmentioned institutions who want to contact me in any way must likewise be bound by ethics and law, wherein they shall not have a recent 10-year history of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initiating, encouraging, or spreading medical, historical, scientific, or legal disinformation/misinformation;</li>
    <li>Any ban-listed items off of the sponsorships and company visits list (implied included);</li>
    <li>Demonstrated largely black hat hacking, distribution of malware, or otherwise (including those who rented even a chair or a desk to one bad actor in this list item);</li>
    <li>Dropping a rank or multiple ranks among their state/province education systems regarding not the sports, but the academic competencies to achieve at least a CTE level;</li>
    <li>Having a history of medical or legal malpractice;</li>
    <li>One incident of any terrorism (mainly a crime of which fear is instilled upon innocence) committed by one of their members.</li>
</ul>
  <p>
    Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain ethical conduct, respect all personal and professional boundaries, and possess verified fluency in the English language. Excessive vulgarity, presumptive tone, invasive behavior, or breach of conduct standards shall result in permanent blacklisting.
  </p>
  <h3>Consent, Usage &amp; Likeness</h3>
  <p>
    Filming, recording, or content creation featuring me as the primary subject or focal point requires prior explicit written consent obtained via the designated form accessible 
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any content in which I appear—granted only under explicit, documented, and prior consent—must comply with the following mandatory safeguards: all visual frames featuring my image must apply a localized Gaussian blur mask fully encompassing my entire figure. The resolution of this mask must be no less than the diagonal pixel count of the largest commercially available device anticipated in the distribution, publication, or playback chain. All accompanying audio tracks must be irreversibly modified to obscure my natural tone, pitch, cadence, and frequency profile. Furthermore, each visual frame must be post-processed—whether after live stream or recorded production—using robust AI poisoning techniques explicitly designed to render the content unsuitable for training datasets, machine learning inference, or generative model synthesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    At no point—whether prior to release, during recording, or post-release—may the content creator disclose any information beyond acknowledgment of collaboration and the fact of meeting me. Any mention or implication of knowledge regarding my appearance, scent, voice, or any biometric identifiers is strictly prohibited. These conditions serve as preemptive safeguards against misuse by malicious actors irrespective of jurisdiction, intent, or affiliation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unauthorized publication or dissemination of my unaltered facial likeness, voice, or biometric identifiers by any external party constitutes a direct and actionable violation of these Terms and Conditions. Such breaches will trigger immediate and automatic eternal blacklisting of the individual and all affiliated parties. At my sole discretion, a formal takedown request may be issued, requiring full compliance without delay or objection. Continued possession or distribution of infringing material after notice shall constitute willful infringement, potentially provoking legal action across all relevant jurisdictions and resulting in permanent disqualification from future collaborations regardless of subsequent forgiveness requests. This includes stalking of any form.
  </p>
  <p>
    Defamatory, racialized, dehumanizing, or falsely consenting portrayals—regardless of format—are the sole responsibility of their creators. While satire and parody protections under applicable law are recognized, such content may still be publicly declared unauthorized and unendorsed by me. Legal tolerance does not imply ethical alignment. All creators assume full accountability for reputational, social, and legal consequences arising therefrom.
  </p>
  <p>
    Incidental appearances require no prior consent unless the footage is deliberately reframed to present me as a primary secondary, or one of the many subjects of focus. All live stream collaborations must comply fully with the conditions outlined herein and related provisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My likeness, name, voice, habits, or creative works may not be used for AI training, derivative media, sublicensing, or transfer without explicit prior written consent. Subsequently, the violation of this paragraph and the ones above is not a ticket to add to the pressure of which may be called an push for an official face or voice reveal, but if so, the viewers and hosts have to consent to seeing me with identity masked for the rest of my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Agreements or media created under coercion, surveillance, phishing, impersonation, or any form of undue influence are null, void, and unenforceable both ethically and legally. Unauthorized disclosures under such circumstances are invalid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Violations render offending works non-conformative, inadmissible, and ethically void within the public record. I am under no obligation to acknowledge, respond to, or validate such portrayals. Their credibility is subject to public scrutiny and the conscience of creators, with the presumption that audiences apply critical judgment. Unless I have committed the alleged acts as defined under applicable law, such portrayals shall be considered self-discrediting and not legitimate representations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any adaptations require formal written contracts. Intellectual property rights remain solely mine and are non-transferable for the full legal copyright term commencing at the latest publications featuring me as subject; extendable only in terms pertaining to literary legacy of my works and my name.
  </p>
  <p>
    During all stages of drafting, editing, promotion, and distribution period (including but not limited to: screenings, consumers buying, others making a review of the product / products), original production staff must remain unchanged. Any death, resignation, transfer, or reassignment—except voluntary retirement at industry-standard age without coercion—shall result in project termination and restart; any continuation to thereof is at the peril of voiding any further interaction with the producers, staff, and creators involved or featured in such projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI may be utilized only as a creative support tool under direct human oversight. AI replacement of creators is expressly prohibited unless genuine Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with full creative autonomy is demonstrably achieved.
  </p>
  <p>
  Ninety-nine percent (99%) of all net profits derived from the creation, publication, distribution, adaptation, or commercialization of any third-party work incorporating my original intellectual property—including but not limited to characters, items, settings, or narrative constructs as defined in these Terms and Conditions—shall be payable to me in perpetuity of copyright of the latest works.
</p>
<p>
  In the event such third-party works incur financial loss, those losses shall be treated as liquidated damages at the same ninety-nine percent (99%) rate, payable in equal installments every forty-six (46) calendar days beginning from the first full calendar year following initial public release.
</p>
<p>
  Any third-party creation, distribution, sale, or adaptation of merchandise, media, or derivative works based on my intellectual property requires express written authorization and shall remain subject to the same compensation terms stated above, regardless of medium, platform, or scale of production.
</p>
<p>
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this compensation obligation shall not apply to any publishing or distribution platform—such as Draft2Digital or equivalent services—that I have personally and explicitly engaged under my sole discretion for the limited purpose of publishing or facilitating access to my original works. These platforms are recognized strictly as intermediaries and shall hold no derivative, adaptive, or commercial rights beyond those contractually necessary to perform their distribution functions.
</p>
<p>
  This exception does not extend to any third party who independently uses the same or similar platforms or distribution programs without my explicit authorization; such parties remain fully subject to all compensation obligations and restrictions set forth herein.
</p>
<p>
  The profitability or lack thereof—including commercial failure or critical success—shall in no way affect the enforceability of this compensation clause. Works archived solely for historical preservation are exempt and shall not be considered commercial use, nor subject to royalties or damage claims, but as per expectations, be closed forever once archived; no human or machine that knows or by general nationwide expectaions to know how to read and interpret this language are barred form ever touching it, with touching in any way be considered the same as the violation of the concept used by norms set around historic artifacts on display.
</p>
<p>
  For the avoidance of doubt, all references to adaptations, third-party works, derivative works, or comparable terms shall include any creation—regardless of medium or format—that mimics, incorporates, reinterprets, or is demonstrably based upon any character, item, structure, or concept originating from my original works. This inclusion applies irrespective of whether such elements have been modified, reordered, renamed, or embedded within a new narrative or creative context, provided that the origin remains reasonably identifiable.
</p>
<p>
  This provision does not extend to uses that fall squarely within protected categories of parody or satire as expressly defined under applicable law, specifically when such use is clearly transformative and intended for commentary, criticism, or expressive ridicule. Mere stylistic mimicry, tonal borrowing, or narrative recontextualization without such purpose shall not qualify for this exception.
</p>
<p>
  Any third party who includes such elements without prior authorization must, for the full remaining duration of applicable copyright, visibly and unambiguously credit this pen name in all distributed versions and formats of the work. Failure to comply will result in automatic and permanent disqualification from any collaborative opportunity and may trigger legal enforcement measures, including takedown notices or formal litigation, at my sole discretion.
</p>
  <p>
    AI use is restricted to photorealistic post-production enhancements meeting or exceeding the quality standards exemplified by the film that is relatively and constantly last year's highest award winners of the most prestigious awards within the adapation's applicable categories; the present in this case being the current moment when doing such visual projects that may last multiple years. Promotional materials must exclude plot specifics and character outcomes. Adaptations must remain textually faithful, allowing only minimal interpretive latitude only in places where in the adapted work's scource, is not defined and not set by previous chapters if it is a standalone or books if it is part of a book series.
  </p>
  <p>
    All parties are blacklisted unless explicitly whitelisted via completion of the designated consent form. My emailed reply to the submitted address constitutes confirmation of consent. Denials may redirect correspondents to these Terms and Conditions in such replies. Contact attempts without completed forms or where stated reasons materially differ from actual conduct or remain too vague shall be considered invalid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Absence of response shall not be construed as consent. Any attempts to circumvent these Terms and Conditions (including doctoring media in order to show consent) will result in permanent silence in future filled-out contact forms filled out by the violator and may trigger legal action.
  </p>
  <p>
    If these Terms are considered onerous, I may, at my sole discretion, streamline procedural requirements for a limited number of known creators. However, this does not constitute an exemption from any provision herein. Enforcement shall operate under a strict policy, wherein any violation substantiated by previously available content in breach of these Terms shall result in immediate disqualification from further engagement until a public apology is made in which I am not an invited guest to the content of the apology.
  </p>
  <p>
  These Terms and Conditions are binding both during my lifetime and posthumously, and shall be enforceable by my designated literary estate. In the absence of an established estate, enforcement rights shall transfer to my appointed executors or trustees. However, any executor or trustee—whether individual or institutional—who, through physical, verbal, written, or digital actions, publicly or privately discredits, undermines, or otherwise represents these Terms and Conditions in a disparaging or oppositional manner, regardless of intent or justification, shall be deemed illegitimate, disavowed, and permanently stripped of all associated rights, authority, and affiliation. In such cases, they must either: (a) immediately and transparently appoint a qualified successor—individual or organization—with a minimum ten-year record of reputable conduct and public credibility, or (b) transfer responsibility to a surviving relative or institution demonstrably capable of upholding the original intent of these Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Should all aforementioned designations—whether estate, executor, trustee, or appointed successor—fail, become inoperative, or be rendered illegitimate, all rights, licenses, and obligations governed by these Terms and Conditions shall immediately and automatically revert to a default <strong>“all-rights-reserved”</strong> status. This default shall endure for the maximum period permitted under the longest-standing national copyright term recognized by international law, specifically as upheld by the geographically nearest sovereign country that: (1) is recognized by no fewer than three major intergovernmental organizations, and (2) has neither enacted nor proposed any legislation restricting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or comparable civil liberties within the ten years preceding said reversion.
</p>
<p>
  This default state is strictly irrevocable and shall remain in effect unless—and only if—a legitimate and demonstrably qualified successor emerges who fully upholds and executes all provisions of these Terms and Conditions in unbroken continuity. Such emergence must occur prior to the expiration of the global maximum term defined above; otherwise, the default shall remain permanently binding and nontransferable.
</p>
<p>
  Trustees or executors who designate time capsules as successors must also name a secondary, sentient, non-time-capsule successor capable of immediately continuing these terms, and not to be considered an IP split or cross-lisencing as long as the secondary is one of the chooser's ally that meets all applicable restrictions and expectations applied implicitly and explicitly by this document. All amendments to such agreements in this scenario and the one involving transferrence to another entity of sentience must be formally notarized and signed in duplicate by both the undersigned party and the designated recipient. No presumed intent or implied agreement shall be recognized under any circumstances.
</p>
  <p>The intellectual property (IP) developed by this entity, including all associated patents, trademarks, copyrights, tangible, and other intangible assets, shall remain non-transferable. No IP shall be sold, licensed, sublicensed, or assigned to third parties except as expressly permitted in writing under this agreement and by the tangible evidence by the entity. Attempts to bypass or obscure this requirement through IP-related financial arrangements will result in immediate liability and instant inelegibility.</p>
  <p>Any financial arrangement, structuring, or transfer involving the entity’s intellectual property, including but not limited to cross-licensing agreements, IP splits, or assignments, even if not in direct violation of legal frameworks, that could be perceived as an attempt to circumvent the provisions outlined herein, will be considered in violation and subject to the consequences of immediate liability and ineligibility.</p>
<p>In the event of any dispute arising from the enforcement, interpretation, or breach of this agreement, including but not limited to matters involving intellectual property or its transfer, the parties agree that such dispute shall be resolved exclusively through a bench trial. The trial shall be held in the jurisdiction of my place of residence at the time of the dispute, and shall be presided over by a judge with expertise in intellectual property law or commercial contracts. Any request for a jury trial or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods shall be deemed invalid and immediately dismissed.
