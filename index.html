    <h1>Q. Dagbjort Huangington</h1>
    <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.
    </p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.
    </p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.
    </p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p>
      The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="contact-terms">
  <h2>Contact / Terms & Conditions</h2>
<div class="contact">
  <p>
    By accessing this page, referencing my works, or engaging in any communication, you unconditionally agree to all terms stated herein. These terms are legally binding, irrevocable, non-negotiable, and enforceable under all applicable laws and jurisdictions. Non-compliance constitutes breach of contract and infringement of intellectual property rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    No contact attempt shall be valid or actionable unless initiated by a competent, verifiable legal authority under active statutory jurisdiction, supported by verifiable documentation with a full chain of custody. Claims of compulsion, narrative obligation, or indirect authority are null and void. Unqualified communications are unsolicited and will be disregarded.
  </p>
  <p>
Media invitations are recognized solely if initiated by nationally recognized authorities or major public figures originating from politically neutral states—excluding individuals with explicit affiliations to either right-wing or left-wing ideologies, regardless of their official capacity. A state is deemed ineligible if it fails to demonstrate transparent governance, uphold human rights, or refrainment from protectionist or censorial practices—including, but not limited to, the deportation of foreigners under the guise of patriotism (more precisely, nationalism), rather than in response to individual, verifiable criminal acts supported by physical evidence and made publicly accessible for independent verification, particularly by alien residents or neutral observers. Once a state enacts legislation or policy that contravenes these principles (and more outlined in this Terms & Conditions), it remains disqualified unless such actions are formally reversed through enforceable and transparent legal measures that preclude recurrence through loopholes or discretionary abuse. Mere repeal, delay, or symbolic gestures shall not reinstate eligibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entities engaged in active conflict, sanctions, proxy aggression, or with documented violations of the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> or <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> within the past decade are disqualified.
  </p>
<p>
  Any country, territory, jurisdiction, or entity shall be considered <strong>ineligible</strong> for engagement, collaboration, or correspondence under these Terms and Conditions if it maintains, supports, or has a documented historical pattern of military buildup, arms expansion, or force projection during peacetime—whether independently, through occupation, through allied presence, or via proxy agreements. This ineligibility includes jurisdictions engaged in militarized economic zones, defense-centric industrial subsidies, or habitual mobilization under pretexts of deterrence or strategic posturing.
</p>
<p>
  Exceptions are made exclusively for jurisdictions that meet all of the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Maintain no standing military, do not host foreign military bases or allied forces, and refrain from any covert military cooperation—even during periods of internal instability—unless such cooperation ceased immediately following the removal of a leadership regime that willfully violated the principles outlined in the fourth paragraph above;
  </li>
  <li>
    Demonstrate internationally recognized neutrality, as exemplified by the Swiss Confederation;
  </li>
  <li>
    Are members of international or supranational organizations whose founding charters are explicitly non-military in scope (e.g., humanitarian, cultural, or scientific), provided such affiliations are not exploited as conduits for soft influence, associative branding, or diplomatic circumvention of these terms.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any past or present affiliation with militarized entities shall override non-military affiliations upon involvement—directly, indirectly, or by proxy—in armed conflict, weapons supply, or proxy war engagement. This disqualification extends to actions framed as morally justified or retaliatory (e.g., preemptive, ideological, or retaliatory wars such as Vietnam), when such justification lacks enduring ethical consensus or results in conflict deemed senseless or disproportionate by post-engagement evaluations. Announcements of war cessation or peace declarations—such as those seen following early stages of post-9/11 military operations—do not reinstate eligibility if residual or systemic consequences of such campaigns persist.
</p>
<p>
  Any form of prestige-based infiltration, soft power maneuvering, associative branding, or diplomatic Trojan-horse tactics intended to bypass these conditions—whether through joint ventures, celebrity endorsements, honorary designations, or cultural ambassadorships—shall constitute a direct violation. Eligibility requires not only formal nonalignment but also a demonstrable absence of intent, infrastructure, or proxy mechanisms capable of undermining these terms through implication, association, or backdoor influence.
</p>
  <p>
    Governance must exhibit peaceful power transitions, independent judiciary, resolution of territorial disputes, and support for unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchange.
  </p>

  <p>
    Physical meetings require secure, controlled environments prohibiting flash photography, drones, visible aircraft, weapons, and unauthorized gatherings. Representatives must be from fully compliant jurisdictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sponsorships and company visits are disqualified if affiliated, currently or within the last fiscal season, with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intrusive or deceptive advertising (e.g., autoplay, fake skip buttons)</li>
    <li>Misleading product labeling or representation</li>
    <li>Industries such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, or sex work platforms</li>
    <li>Entities involved in scandals, fraud, harassment, or associated with known bad actors</li>
    <li>Use of microtransactions without lifetime one-time payment alternatives</li>
    <li>Recurring payment plans unaffordable at the lowest legal wage in hyperinflated economies</li>
    <li>Stacked, unskippable, or excessive advertisements requiring ad blockers</li>
    <li>Low-value goods or services with disproportionate profits and minimal authentic customer satisfaction</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain ethical conduct, respect boundaries, and possess English fluency; excessive vulgarity, presumptive tone, or invasive conduct results in permanent blacklisting.
  </p>
  <h3>Consent, Usage & Likeness</h3>
  <p>
    Filming, recording, or content creation featuring me as subject or focus requires prior explicit written consent via the designated form linked
    <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Any content in which I appear—under explicit, documented, and prior consent—must adhere to the following non-negotiable safeguards: all visual frames featuring me must apply a localized Gaussian blur mask encompassing my entire figure, with a resolution no less than the diagonal pixel count of the largest commercially available device anticipated in the distribution, publication, or playback chain. All accompanying audio must be irreversibly modified to obscure my natural tone, pitch, cadence, and frequency profile. Furthermore, each visual frame must be post-processed—whether after livestream or recorded production—with robust AI poisoning techniques designed to render the content unsuitable for dataset training, machine learning inference, or generative model synthesis.
</p>
<p>
  At no point—whether pre-release, during recording, or post-release—may the creator disclose any information beyond acknowledgment of the collaboration and the fact that they met me. Any mention or implication of knowing my appearance, scent, voice, or any biometric detail is strictly prohibited. These conditions are mandatory and serve as preemptive safeguards against misuse by malicious actors, irrespective of jurisdiction, intent, or affiliation.
</p>
<p>
Any publication or dissemination of my unaltered facial likeness, voice, or biometric identifiers by an external party constitutes a direct and actionable violation of these Terms & Conditions. Such breaches trigger immediate and automatic blacklisting of the individual and all affiliated parties. At my sole discretion, a formal takedown request may be issued, and full compliance is required without delay or objection. Continued possession or distribution of the infringing material after notice constitutes willful infringement, potentially provoking legal action across all relevant jurisdictions, and by default permanently disqualifies the offender from any future collaboration—regardless of any subsequent requests for forgiveness.
</p>
<p>
  Defamatory, racialized, dehumanizing, or falsely consenting portrayals—regardless of format—remain solely the responsibility of their creators. Although satire and parody protections are recognized under applicable law, such content may still be publicly declared unauthorized and unendorsed by me. Legal tolerance does not imply ethical alignment, and all creators assume full accountability for reputational, social, and legal consequences.
</p>
<p>
  Incidental appearances require no prior consent unless the footage is deliberately reframed to present me as a primary or secondary focus. All livestream collaborations must comply with the conditions outlined herein and in related provisions.
</p>
  <p>
    My likeness, name, voice, or creative works may not be used for AI training, derivative media, sublicensing, or transfer without explicit written consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Agreements or media created under coercion, surveillance, phishing, impersonation, or undue influence are null and void. Unauthorized disclosures are invalid ethically and legally.
  </p>
  <p>
  Violations render the offending works non-conformative, inadmissible, and ethically void in the public record. I am under no obligation to acknowledge, respond to, or validate such portrayals. Their credibility is left to the scrutiny of the public and the conscience of the creators, with the expectation that audiences apply critical judgment. As long as I have not committed the alleged acts—by the definitions set forth in applicable law—such portrayals stand as self-discrediting exercises, not legitimate representations.
</p>
  <p>
    Adaptations require formal written contracts. Intellectual property rights remain solely mine and non-transferable for the full legal copyright term from first publication.
  </p>

  <p>
    During drafting, editing, promotion, and screening, all original production staff must remain unchanged. Any death, resignation, transfer, or reassignment (except voluntary retirement at industry-standard age without coercion) requires project termination and restart.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI may only be used as a creative support tool under direct human oversight. AI replacement of creators is prohibited unless genuine AGI with full creative autonomy is achieved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ninety-nine percent (99%) of net profits are payable to me in perpetuity, with losses treated as liquidated damages at the same rate, payable quarterly from the first release year.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI use is restricted to photorealistic post-production enhancements meeting or exceeding <em>Avatar</em> (2009) standards. Promotional materials must exclude plot specifics and character outcomes. Adaptations must remain textually faithful with minimal interpretive latitude.
  </p>

  <p>
    All parties are blacklisted unless explicitly whitelisted via completion of the designated form. My emailed reply to the submitted address constitutes confirmation of consent; denial may redirect to these Terms & Conditions in such emailed replies. Whitelist status is revocable without notice. Contact attempts without form completion are invalid, as are cases where the stated reason and intent on the form materially differ from actual conduct or are too vague.
  </p>

  <p>
    Absence of response does not imply consent. Attempts to circumvent these terms will result in permanent silence and potential legal action.
  </p>

  <p>
    These terms are binding during my lifetime and posthumously, enforceable by my designated literary estate in which if there's none, lasts as long as copyright. Silence or passive conduct does not imply acceptance. Terms apply universally across all jurisdictions and contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    All legal disputes naming me as the defendant rather than the or a part of the plantiff—whether arising after any interaction initiated via form submission, or relating to this individual under the pen name associated with the author logo—must be filed exclusively in verified jurisdictions and represented by duly licensed, independent counsel in ethical standing. Only formal bench trials are permitted; arbitration, mediation, and alternative dispute mechanisms are expressly excluded. I bear no obligation to engage with claims rooted in distortion, fabrication, speculative narrative, or demonstrable bad faith. I thus in such cases, stand valid to be charged in the immediate futures of each case with perjury.
  </p>
  <p>
    If wrongfully accused, sued, harmed, or killed—including in disputed or no-man’s-land territories—investigations shall be at least expected to involve all competent authorities local to the event and all applicable entitled by hierarchy or law in which must be superiors to the competent authorities. This includes nearest nations, last recorded vehicle docking or landing sites, manufacture and registration countries, all online and private communications (digital or physical) of suspects, authorities presiding over areas of known residences and travel histories of those suspects, medical and psychological records, and relevant familial and generational associations. This clause mandates comprehensive, cooperative inquiry without presumption of guilt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Media and platforms possessing related materials must impose an immediate moratorium on dissemination pending investigation. Premature or speculative reporting is a violation and grounds for permanent non-engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Public presence confers no entitlement. Visibility does not equal accessibility. Jurisdiction does not entail nearness. A name does not constitute identity.</em>
