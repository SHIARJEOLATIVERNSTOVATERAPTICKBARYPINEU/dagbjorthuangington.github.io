    <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I am an author born in Shanghai, hailing from a family with modest economic means. My parents worked for two well-known tech companies, earning a decent living, but not on par with the wealthier individuals in our community. I was born in the year that marked the unveiling of the stone slate, and while I was an extroverted child, I have since transformed into a more reclusive introvert.</p>
    <p> 
    Those who don’t know me might find my demeanor amusing, but I assure you that I don’t take jokes lightly. In collaborative settings, I tend to take on a supportive role, where second chances are rare unless the circumstances are clearly defined. Otherwise, I'd enforce the boundaries set by the task.</p>
    <p>
    As for my interests, I enjoy reading anything from thick textbooks to engaging novels, watching documentaries, sewing a bit, playing board games, and writing, crunching numbers, exploring history, walking long distances (more than 1 hour + 30 min for a cool day), and diving into theoretical concepts. These activities keep me occupied, although I often find myself pacing while I think.</p>
    <p>
    When it comes to writing, I don’t follow a strict plan. I don't set deadlines. I also don't set a solid plot; I spontaneously write each peice of the plot by the day. I only set tto myself, that the works I am currently working on are better than my finished and published ones at minimum. Thus, the works are varied, but each time it's both a testing of the waters which I regard to be age-appropriate, and an solo-ist.
     The first book was written out of contained anger, the second an attempt, and the third an attept; those three made me realize that instead of a fantasy writer, I am more grounded in the science of such mysteries. Thereof, I used my notes from when I was in school to help me at least guide the functions that lay beneath the interactions between the world and the interactions between characters to build the stories I tell.</p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p>
      The author’s creations remain private. What exists is not always shared, and what is shared is not always what exists.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="contact-terms">
  <h2>Contact / Terms & Conditions</h2>
  <div class="contact">
    <p>
      Media invitations—present or future—will only be acknowledged if initiated by a recognized authority or major public figure, subject to strict hierarchical evaluation. National-level representatives must originate from states demonstrating <strong>political neutrality</strong>: no protectionist economics, no discriminatory legal shields, and no sub- or supra-national constructs used to bypass accountability or public health standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countries must not be engaged in conflict, civil unrest, or martial law, and must show no record within the last decade of initiating or supporting warfare or proxy aggression. <strong>Full adherence</strong> to conventions such as the <abbr title="Universal Declaration of Human Rights">UDHR</abbr> and <abbr title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights">ICCPR</abbr> is mandatory; censorship, persecution of journalists or creatives, and identity-based punishment are immediate grounds for disqualification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Legitimate governance requires peaceful transitions of power, independent judiciary systems, and no history of regression under scrutiny. Qualified states must also be free of sanctions, unresolved territorial disputes, and open cases relating to crimes against humanity. The civic environment must promote unrestricted academic, cultural, and media exchange—free from ideological filters or propaganda redirection.
    </p>

    <p>
      All physical meetings require a <strong>no-flash, no-drone, no-visible-aircraft, no-weapons, no-mobbing safety zone</strong>. Supranational or regional figures may only represent fully compliant zones and must not leverage interaction to legitimize non-compliant entities. Municipal leaders must govern conflict-free areas and meet all higher-tier criteria in full.
    </p>

    <p>
      Company figures are disqualified if affiliated—currently or within the last fiscal season—with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intrusive advertising formats (e.g., RAID-style repetition)</li>
      <li>Deceptive labeling (e.g., disguised sugars, hidden percentages)</li>
      <li>Industries including: alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fast food, prostitution</li>
      <li>Any scandal, fraud, harassment incident, or proximity to bad actors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Journalists, podcasters, and creators must maintain a clean professional record, uphold individual dignity, and demonstrate consistent ethical conduct. Light swearing is tolerated; <strong>excessive vulgarity, unsolicited proposals, presumptive tone, or invasive behavior</strong> (flashes, sudden lighting, etc.) may result in blacklisting. English fluency is required (ESL or equivalent); conversational Mandarin is preferred but not mandatory.
    </p>

    <h3>Consent, Usage & Likeness</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Filming with intent</strong>—where I appear as subject, narrator, or focal point—requires prior, explicit, verifiable, and revocable consent, documented through the designated form linked <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Approved recordings must apply a Gaussian blur at minimum equal to the diagonal pixel count of the largest anticipated viewing device (no less than 1920 pixels for HD screens). All audio must be irreversibly altered to mask natural tone, pitch, and frequency, ensuring complete de-identification.
    </p>

    <p>
  Incidental appearances (background only) require no consent unless reframed or manipulated post-capture to make me a partial or immediate focus. <strong>Live streaming is strictly prohibited—for both streamers and viewers—even if conducted under permit.</strong> These terms apply equally to influencers and independent content creators, regardless of reach or platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      My likeness, name, voice, or creative works may not be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulated, trained upon, or inferred into AI models or datasets, directly or indirectly, without explicit written consent</li>
      <li>Used in derivative, reaction-based, satirical, or commentary media without express approval</li>
      <li>Sublicensed, redistributed, or transferred to third parties under any circumstances</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Any agreement secured under surveillance, leaks, phising, coercion, constraint, or undue influence is null and void. Any media produced or leaked under such conditions—including phishing or unauthorized disclosures—are equally void. These terms remain perpetually binding and non-negotiable, surviving beyond my lifetime and enforceable solely by my designated literary estate. Silence, ambiguity, or tacit acquiescence shall never constitute permission. No portion of these terms shall be interpreted to imply traceability, jurisdictional fixity, or personal identity. Therefore, the only way to meet me is by acceptance of the form linked above.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>What exists is not always shared. What is shared is not always what exists. Public presence is not public property. Laws apply—yours, and mine, whereto may not be where you find me.</em>
