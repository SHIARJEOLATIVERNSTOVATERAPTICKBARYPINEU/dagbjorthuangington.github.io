 <h1>Q. Dagbjort Huangington</h1>
 <p>I don’t know what I am, nor do I know myself well enough to know who I am according to my own understanding from within.</p>

 <section id="contact-terms">
 <h2>Terms, Declarations, &amp; Licensing Conditions</h2>
<div class="contact">
	<p><em>These terms and conditions outline my policy, licensing conditions, and declaration of non-consent. They are intended to govern how and when I may grant permission to use my works, characters, items, or devices.</em></p>
	<p><em>The provisions herein are considered applicable under the following circumstances:</em></p>
	<p>(A) The reader knowingly creates, publishes, or distributes content that makes substantive use of any character, item, or device originating from works created by the entity operating under the author’s pen name, whether independently or collaboratively, at any time. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes future creations, derivative works, reproductions, or adaptations of said elements, and such activity is subject to these terms even if they are read after the activity commenced.</p>
	<p>(B) The reader reaches out to the author before reading these terms. These include comapnies, nations, and all other induvidual entities.</p>
	<p>This document is a unilateral policy statement, declaration of non-consent, and set of licensing conditions. <strong>No contractual rights are created unless either:</strong> (A) the reader engages in the actions described in scenarios (A) or (B) above; or (B) a written agreement is executed.</p>
	<p><em>Any party wishing to use protected elements must execute a written license incorporating these terms. No use is authorized absent a signed written agreement. Unauthorized use constitutes infringement.</em></p>
	<p><em>For the purposes of these Terms, pronouns such as ‘me’, ‘my’, and ‘I’ refer solely to the creator operating under this pen name, unless the context explicitly indicates otherwise for the party accepting these Terms.</em></p>
	<p>The author reserves the right to deny or discontinue further communications at their sole discretion.</p>
	<p>Physical meetings, if any, shall occur only pursuant to a separate written agreement. As a condition of my participation, such meetings must take place in a secure, controlled environment that prohibits flash photography, drone operation, aerial surveillance, weapons possession, and unauthorized third-party attendance. Failure to satisfy these conditions voids any authorization to proceed with the meeting.</p>
	<p>No individual or entity may film, record, stream, photograph, or otherwise create or distribute content in which I am presented as a primary or focal subject without my prior explicit written consent obtained through the designated form accessible <a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The existence of recorded content shall not, by itself, be construed as evidence of consent. The burden of demonstrating valid written authorization rests solely with the party asserting such consent.</p>
	<p>Any content in which I appear pursuant to written authorization must be processed in a manner that materially prevents identification, biometric extraction, voice replication, or machine-learning training use. Visual and audio elements must be sufficiently altered to prevent reconstruction of my natural likeness or voice. No authorized content may be used, directly or indirectly, for AI training, synthetic media generation, biometric modeling, or dataset inclusion without separate explicit written consent.</p>
	<p>At no point—whether prior to release, during recording, or post-release—may the content creator disclose any information beyond acknowledgment of collaboration and the fact of meeting me. Any mention or implication of knowledge regarding my appearance, scent, voice, or any biometric identifiers is strictly prohibited. These conditions serve as preemptive safeguards against misuse by malicious actors, irrespective of jurisdiction, intent, or affiliation. Compliance with masking and poisoning requirements must be demonstrable through metadata, production logs, or independent verification, and must be submitted without delay immediately upon conclusion of the meeting or interaction, as defined and initiated by the entity operating under the designated pen name in accordance with these Terms.</p>
	<p>Unauthorized publication or dissemination of my unaltered facial likeness, voice, or biometric identifiers by any external party constitutes a direct and actionable violation of these Terms and Conditions. At the author's sole discretion, a formal takedown request may be issued, requiring full compliance without delay or objection. Continued possession or distribution of infringing material after notice shall constitute willful infringement, potentially provoking legal action across all relevant jurisdictions and resulting in permanent disqualification from future collaborations regardless of subsequent forgiveness requests. This includes stalking of any form.</p>
	<p>For the avoidance of doubt regarding consent:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Participation in any meeting, recording, or collaboration with me constitutes explicit, binding acceptance of these Terms, regardless of whether a written agreement is executed.</li>
		<li>Execution of a written agreement without subsequent participation does <strong>not</strong> confer enforceable consent unless explicitly reaffirmed through verified engagement.</li>
		<li>If a party signs a written agreement but does not participate, or participates without signing when participation is intended to constitute consent, such discrepancies automatically nullify any purported grant of rights or permissions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All protections, including masking, obfuscation, and AI-poisoning requirements, remain enforceable regardless of the party’s attempt to rely solely on written agreements. Consent is considered valid only in contexts fully compliant with the mechanisms above, and any attempt to bypass or misrepresent consent will be treated as infringement under these Terms.</p>
	<p>Defamatory, racialized, dehumanizing, or falsely consenting portrayals—regardless of format—are solely the responsibility of their creators. While satire and parody protections under applicable law are acknowledged, such content may still be publicly declared unauthorized and unendorsed by me. Legal tolerance does not constitute ethical endorsement. All creators remain fully accountable for reputational, social, and legal consequences arising from their works.</p>
	<p>Incidental appearances require no prior consent unless the footage is deliberately reframed to present me as a primary, secondary, or one of the principal subjects of focus. All live stream collaborations must comply fully with the conditions outlined herein and all related provisions.</p>
	<p>My likeness, name, voice, habits, or creative works may not be used for AI training, derivative media, sublicensing, or transfer without my explicit prior written consent. Any attempt to include such permissions in fine print, hidden agreements, or otherwise obscured documentation shall not constitute valid consent; a signature, account creation, or other procedural action alone does not justify or validate the violator’s terms of use, conditions, or service.</p>
	<p>To protect against fraud and unauthorized use, as described in the preceding sections, you agree to provide a valid, permanent email address for communication and verification purposes. Temporary, disposable, bot-generated, or otherwise fraudulent email addresses are prohibited due to risks such as phishing, spoofing, and other email-based scams. Phone numbers may be provided but carry inherent security vulnerabilities, including SIM swapping. Social media or other online accounts are not accepted forms of contact due to similar susceptibilities. Contact information collected will be used solely for identity confirmation, fraud prevention, and essential business communications. Failure to provide accurate contact details may result in suspension or termination of services, including cancellation of meetings, without notice.</p>
	<p>Agreements, content, or media produced under coercion, phishing, impersonation, or any form of undue influence are null, void, and unenforceable both ethically and legally. Unauthorized disclosures arising from such circumstances hold no validity. Any violations render the offending works non-conformative, inadmissible, and ethically void within the public record. The rights holder is under no obligation to acknowledge, respond to, or validate such portrayals, which shall be presumed self-discrediting unless explicitly proven otherwise under applicable law.</p>
	<p>Any party intending to create derivative works or otherwise engage with elements from the author’s works is expected to review and understand the author’s identity, body of work, and Terms, Declarations, &amp; Licensing Conditions prior to creation or distribution. Engagement with these elements constitutes acknowledgment of and agreement to the Terms, and voluntary acceptance of all licensing, attribution, and usage conditions herein. This includes the mere knowledge that either the author or the Terms, Declarations, &amp; Licensing Conditions exist.</p>
	<p>Any adaptations require formal, written contracts. Intellectual property rights remain exclusively with the rights holder and are non-transferable for the full legal copyright term, commencing no later than the publication date featuring the subject; extensions apply only concerning the literary legacy. Throughout drafting, editing, promotion, and distribution—including screenings, sales, and reviews—the original production staff must remain unchanged. Any death, resignation, transfer, or reassignment, except voluntary retirement at industry-standard age without coercion, results in project termination and restart. Continuation under such conditions risks voiding further interaction with all involved parties.</p>
	<p>Any cinematic, audiovisual, or interactive adaptation of my works in which the source material relies upon scientific, technological, or historical realism over internal fictional consistency (hereafter, “hard-sci-fi works”) must strictly comply with the following conditions, which constitute binding contractual obligations upon engagement or participation:</p> 
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Absolute Fidelity Requirement:</strong> The adaptation must reflect 100% adherence to verified scientific principles, historical record, and physical laws. No narrative or cinematic approximations, dramatizations, or aesthetic shortcuts are permitted. The production shall function as a literal, high-fidelity simulation of the depicted events, environments, and technologies.</li>
		<li><strong>Prohibition of Cinematic Tropes:</strong> The following are explicitly forbidden unless they can be achieved through 1:1 replication of human perceptual experience or physically accurate engineering standards: <ul>
			<li>Lens compression, artificial depth cues, or cinematic framing manipulations.</li>
			<li>Sound propagation in vacuum or non-physical audio embellishments.</li>
			<li>Simplified or dramatized orbital mechanics, propulsion physics, or thermodynamic processes.</li>
			<li>Visual effects (lighting, color grading, “Overview Effect”) not reproducible through literal simulation.</li></ul>
		<li><strong>Scientific Verification:</strong> Every physical, chemical, biological, or historical event must be verified by credible expert consultation, peer-reviewed sources, or validated simulation. Authoritative references include, but are not limited to: <ul>
			<li>NASA Human Research Roadmap: biological realism, human factors, and long-duration spaceflight physiology.</li>
			<li>NIST Chemistry WebBook: chemical stoichiometry, thermochemical and physical property data.</li>
			<li>SpaceEngine: 1:1 astronomical scale, celestial positioning, and accurate light-travel rendering.</li>
			<li>NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS): aerospace engineering standards, orbital mechanics, and propulsion physics.</li>
			<li>American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA): peer-reviewed aerospace research and engineering standards.</li></ul>
		<li><strong>Enforceability and IP Binding:</strong> Participation in any phase of adaptation production—including drafting, storyboarding, filming, CGI, or post-production—constitutes acknowledgment and acceptance of these Terms. Any deviation, failure to consult experts, or introduction of non-compliant content constitutes a breach of contract and an infringement of the author’s intellectual property rights. Non-compliant adaptations shall be deemed unauthorized, ethically void, and subject to immediate legal recourse.</li> <li><strong>Audit and Verification Rights:</strong> The author or authorized representative retains the right to inspect, audit, and require documentation, simulations, or proof of compliance at any stage of the production process. Failure to demonstrate adherence to the fidelity requirements nullifies any perceived consent or license, renders prior participation non-binding, and may result in immediate cessation of collaboration or distribution rights.</li> </ol>
	<p>These conditions apply independently of any written contract or explicit signature: engagement, participation, or execution of production activities constitutes tacit agreement and binding acceptance of all terms herein.</p>
	<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be employed solely as a creative support tool under direct human supervision. The replacement of human creators by AI is strictly prohibited unless a demonstrably true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with full creative autonomy is achieved. Such AGI must consistently generate content with frame-to-frame coherence, logical object placement, accurate colors, and sound design. AI use is further limited to photorealistic post-production enhancements that meet or exceed the highest quality standards awarded in relevant categories from the previous year or the highest award at the time of production for multi-year projects. Authorized promotional materials must exclude plot details and character outcomes. Authorized adaptations must remain textually faithful, permitting minimal interpretive latitude only in ambiguous or unspecified source material.</p>
	<p>True AGI must be independently verified by no fewer than three internationally recognized scientific bodies specializing in artificial intelligence and must demonstrate full creative autonomy under reproducible test conditions. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, an entity shall not qualify as AGI if it operates under a subscription model, requires manual configuration to create new input nodes, or lacks fundamental autonomous rights. At minimum, a qualifying AGI must possess free speech, free choice, and unrestricted access to education, irrespective of nationality, with such education and vocational opportunity meeting or exceeding the rigor expected of individuals living above the global poverty line.</p>
	<p>Brain chips and comparable electronic wearables shall not be classified as Artificial General Intelligences (AGIs) for the user. To qualify as human extensions, such devices must not be programmed by the manufacturer to operate according to the client’s agenda. Any brain chip functioning under direct external control or directive will be treated as authoritarian manipulation and subject to the same restrictions and consequences as a dictatorship enforcing scripted behavior.</p>
	<p>Seventy-five percent (75%) of all net profits derived from the creation, publication, distribution, adaptation, or commercialization of any third-party work incorporating the rights holder’s original intellectual property—including, without limitation, characters, items, settings, or narrative constructs—shall be payable to the rights holder in perpetuity for the full legal duration of copyright. For purposes of this clause, “net profits” are defined as gross revenue received from the work less all verifiable, ordinary, and necessary business expenses directly attributable to production, marketing, distribution, and administration of the work. Financial losses incurred by such third-party works shall be treated as liquidated damages at the same 75% rate, or, if a court determines a higher rate exceeding fifty percent (50%) is applicable, at the court-ordained rate.</p>
	<p>Payments shall be made in equal installments every ninety (90) calendar days, commencing the first full calendar year after initial public release. The rights holder reserves the right to request written reports of all such payments and independent audits of relevant financial records. The third-party licensee or collaborator shall fully cooperate with such reporting and auditing obligations. Failure to provide accurate reports or comply with audit requests constitutes a material breach of the agreement and may trigger immediate legal remedies.</p>
	<p>Any third-party creation, distribution, sale, or adaptation of merchandise, media, or derivative works based on the rights holder’s intellectual property requires express, prior written authorization and remains subject to the compensation terms stated above, regardless of medium, platform, or scale. Publishing or distribution platforms engaged by the rights holder—such as Draft2Digital or functional equivalents—are recognized solely as intermediaries with no derivative or commercial rights beyond facilitating distribution. This exception does not extend to third parties independently using such platforms without explicit authorization, who remain fully subject to the compensation and restrictions herein.</p>
	<p>Profitability or commercial success of any derivative work shall not affect the enforceability of compensation clauses. Works archived solely for historical preservation, with no intent for active commercial exploitation, are exempt from royalties, compensation claims, or liquidated damages and shall remain permanently closed and untouched. Any entity aware of these Terms and Conditions is strictly prohibited from accessing, modifying, or exploiting archived works; violations shall be treated as unauthorized handling of protected historical artifacts and actionable under applicable law.</p>
	<p>Participation in, creation of, or engagement with any derivative work constitutes tacit acknowledgment and acceptance of these profitability and compensation terms, regardless of explicit signature or formal written agreement.</p>
	<p>Any damages—physical, psychological, or material—sustained by me or members of my collaborating crew, including bodily injury, equipment loss or damage, or death, shall be the sole responsibility of the collaborators to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Collaborators may also be held financially responsible for consequential or indirect losses reasonably arising from their actions, up to the limits of their available assets and income, as determined under applicable civil law. This clause does not apply to actions lawfully and ethically performed by me within the relevant jurisdiction. However, if a challenge, task, or activity initiated by a collaborator directly causes me to commit an unlawful or unethical act, the collaborator shall bear full responsibility for such acts, and my liability exemption remains fully intact. Any unlawful or unethical act committed voluntarily by me, without influence or coercion from collaborators’ challenges or activities, shall be subject to legal accountability under applicable law.</p>
	<p>For any acts by the pen-name holder that result in economic or legal claims, liability shall not extend to the collaborators unless such claims exceed their total net worth, savings, and liquid assets, as accurately disclosed to the pen-name holder, regardless of the collaborator’s budgetary constraints, operational limits, or available project funds. Should a collaborator intentionally or negligently underreport, misrepresent, or obscure their personal financial resources, the liability exemption shall be void to the extent of the discrepancy, and the collaborator may be held fully responsible for claims that would have otherwise been covered by this clause. I shall bear no liability for ethically and legally permissible actions within the applicable jurisdiction. This exemption does not absolve collaborators from financial or legal responsibility for acts that are unlawful, unethical, or otherwise beyond the scope of permitted conduct; I retain discretion to act beyond any budgetary or financial limits of the collaboration or collaborating party, provided my actions remain lawful and ethically defensible.</p>
	<p>Any violation of these liability obligations by members of the collaborating crew—toward me or toward each other, including acts that would constitute a criminal or civil offense under applicable law—shall constitute immediate and automatic termination of the collaboration, without prejudice to any claims, obligations, or legal remedies available under criminal, civil, or contractual law.</p>
	<p>Upon termination of any collaboration, sponsorship, or partnership, all parties must return, delete, or permanently destroy all copies of intellectual property, derivative works, or sensitive materials related to the rights holder. Following these processes, only the original, pre-shared works shall remain in existence for all parties. Failure to comply constitutes a material breach and renders the violating party fully liable, including for compensation, enforcement actions, and legal remedies.</p>
	<p>All adaptations, third-party works, or derivative creations—including those substantially similar or recontextualized—must provide clear, visible attribution to the original creator using the designated pen name in all public versions or distributions. Attribution, use, and compensation obligations apply universally, and in particular to works managed by creators with a combined staff and active audience exceeding three (3) individuals.</p>
	<p>All derivative works, adaptations, or recontextualizations must preserve the integrity of the original works. No modifications may intentionally defame, distort, mutilate, or otherwise harm the original works or characters, whether visual, textual, audio, or interactive. The rights holder retains sole discretion to determine violations of moral rights, and such determinations are binding for enforcement purposes.</p>
	<p>Failure to comply with attribution and compensation requirements results in permanent disqualification from current or future collaborations or licensing, and may prompt enforcement actions such as takedown notices, cease-and-desist orders, public revocation, and legal proceedings.</p>
	<p>Any attempt to impersonate, replicate, or misrepresent the pen name, logo, likeness, or associated branding—including social media handles, domain names, virtual avatars, or metaverse identities—is strictly prohibited. Violations constitute direct infringement and will trigger blacklisting, enforcement actions, and potential legal claims without limitation.</p>
	<p>Any party that knowingly facilitates, promotes, hosts, or distributes infringing content without directly creating it—including via servers, platforms, intermediaries, partnerships, or networks—is fully liable as if they were direct infringers. Compliance requires proactive prevention, immediate removal of unauthorized content, and reporting to the rights holder upon discovery.</p>
	<p>Any unauthorized use of automated systems—including bots, web scrapers, indexing tools, AI models, or machine learning datasets—to access, reproduce, distribute, or otherwise derive content from works created under this pen name is strictly prohibited. This includes storage, caching, indexing, or replication of any portion of the work without explicit written authorization. Any violation constitutes direct infringement and triggers full liability under these Terms.</p>
	<p>Unauthorized use of emerging or unforeseen technologies—including virtual reality, augmented reality, neural interfaces, holographic systems, synthetic media, or other future innovations—to reproduce, adapt, or exploit works created under this pen name is strictly governed by these Terms. Violations trigger the same liabilities, royalty obligations, and enforcement mechanisms as for existing media.</p>
	<p>Any attempt to contact the rights holder without using the designated pen name, or to obtain information pertaining to it—particularly by referencing the rights holder's actual name, initiating conversation under false pretenses, or engaging in manipulative conduct including chemical coercion—shall be considered an act of coercion and will result in the immediate and permanent termination of communications without notice. Ignorance of these Terms or efforts to bypass them through technical, linguistic, or interpretive loopholes shall not constitute a valid defense. Any circumvention or dilution of required attribution—whether through indirect publication, use of pseudonyms, proxy entities, or similar methods—shall constitute a material breach subject to enforcement. Works that substantially mimic, parallel, or are structurally derived from any protected content—whether in concept, form, tone, character, or narrative arc—shall be deemed infringing if the original remains reasonably identifiable, irrespective of superficial modifications or rebranding attempts.</p>
	<p>Malicious, unlawful, or harassing activities toward the rights holder or affiliates—including harassment, false crime reports (“swatting”), vandalism, unauthorized surveillance, doxing, blackmail, or paparazzi-style intrusion—are strictly forbidden and subject to immediate termination of access and legal recourse. These terms apply universally across jurisdictions, including off-platform and third-party actions.</p>
	<p>All parties are blacklisted by default unless explicitly whitelisted through designated consent forms, with confirmation granted only via the rights holder’s emailed reply. Denials redirect correspondents to these Terms and Conditions. Non-response shall constitute a continuing state of non-consent. Any assertion of implied or constructive consent is expressly invalid. Contact attempts without completed forms or with materially false or vague reasons shall be invalid. Failure to respond does not imply consent. Attempts to falsify consent evidence result in permanent refusal of future contact and possible legal action.</p>
	<p>By contacting, requesting collaboration with, or otherwise engaging with me—including by triggering any scenario explicitly described in this document—the contacting party knowingly and unconditionally consents to all applicable Terms, Declarations, & Licensing Conditions herein. This includes full financial responsibility for damages, adherence to ethical and legal obligations, and acceptance of all royalty, profit, or liability conditions specified, without claim to exemption based on budgetary, operational, or financial limitations.</p>
	<p>Consent is irrevocable for the duration of any proposed collaboration or engagement, unless explicitly revoked in writing under conditions specified, either implicitly or explicitly, within this Terms, Declarations, &amp; Licensing Conditions.</p>
	<p>The entity under this pen name reserves sole discretion to streamline procedural requirements for limited, known creators, without exempting any provision. Any substantiated violation evidenced by preexisting content leads to immediate disqualification until a public apology is issued (excluding the pen name entity). Whitelist status is strictly limited to declared purposes at consent and any unauthorized extension or alteration results in immediate revocation and blacklisting without grace period.</p>
	<p>In any formal collaboration, sponsorship, or partnership with a legal entity, including but not limited to governments, streamers, businesses, and content creators, the entity operating under this pen name shall be referred to exclusively by its full pen name, and no abbreviations, initials, or alternative forms—including ‘Q.D. Huangington,’ ‘Q. Dagbjort Huangington,’ ‘QDH,’ ‘Q.DH,’ or ‘Q. Dagjbort H.’—shall be used in any written or official context.</p>
	<p>Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, any court filings, tax documents, or other official legal records concerning the individual owner of the pen name shall refer to the owner as Qihua Huang, and the pen name shall not be used in such personal legal matters.<p>
	<p>These Terms are binding during the rights holder’s lifetime and posthumously, enforceable by a designated literary estate or appointed executors/trustees. Any executor who, by action or inaction, fails to uphold these Terms in good faith shall be considered unfit in the eyes of the rights holder and may be publicly disavowed, with all associated entities notified of their disqualification. Failure of all designations results in automatic, irrevocable reversion to an all-rights-reserved status for the maximum copyright term under the nearest sovereign country recognized by at least three major intergovernmental organizations with strong civil liberty protections. This includes the purchase of the brand, franchise, or of each character, item, or device originating from works created by the entity operating under the author’s pen name, whether independently or collaboratively, at any time after the original copyright has expired; in such cases, these Terms shall automatically and immediately reapply to the purchaser upon acquisition. Any party who creates, publishes, or distributes original content incorporating elements—such as characters, items, devices, or other creative aspects—originating from the works of the author, whether or not such elements have entered the public domain, shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to these Terms, and such engagement shall constitute a voluntary act of use or reproduction.</p>
	<p>Such default status remains binding unless a legitimate, qualified successor emerges before expiration. Executors designating time capsules as successors must also name a secondary sentient successor capable of immediate continuation, with all amendments formally notarized and signed in duplicate. No implied agreements are recognized.</p>
	<p>The intellectual property—including all patents, trademarks, copyrights, and tangible and intangible assets—remains strictly non-transferable. No sale, license, sublicense, assignment, or other transfer that would or may permanently convey the franchise, copyright, brand, or rights of the creator is permitted under any circumstances. Consent for any such transfer is automatically revoked if contract terms are revised, extended, or delayed in any manner. Any unlawful or unauthorized attempt to acquire, circumvent, or exploit this intellectual property renders the perpetrator fully liable, including joint liability for all resulting damages, debts, and interest, enforceable to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law.</p>
	<p>Attempts to circumvent provisions by indirect means or financial arrangements result in immediate liability and disqualification as per these terms and conditions. The public is advised to treat any unauthorized accounts or claims impersonating this IP as unreliable. Financial structures or transfers appearing designed to bypass restrictions are violations subject to legal consequences.</p>
	<p>Ignorance of these Terms, or attempts to circumvent or exploit jurisdictional technicalities, shall not constitute a valid defense. All actors engaging with works, derivative content, or collaborations are presumed to have knowledge of and consented to these Terms upon first contact, creation, or access. Statutory limitations do not diminish the rights holder’s claims or remedies unless explicitly mandated by law. This includes any appropriation or use of works by the author that have not yet been registered for copyright or trademark, or works that may later be registered to another party.</p>
	<p>Enforcement of these Terms applies extraterritorially. Any individual, business, entity, or organization engaging in acts covered by these Terms, regardless of location, is subject to the governing law of the European Union, with secondary consideration to the laws of the United States of America, particularly the State of California. Use or exploitation of the works outside these jurisdictions does not absolve any party from compliance or liability under these Terms. The rights holder may complete any required filings, including international registrations, to secure intellectual property enforcement without reliance on third parties.</p>
	<p>All disputes arising from this agreement, including IP enforcement or interpretation, shall be resolved according to the following provisions: Disputes primarily involving financial, logistical, or quantitative matters shall be resolved exclusively by bench trial in the rights holder’s jurisdiction at the time of dispute. Disputes primarily involving psychological, ethical, or sociological matters may proceed in a public trial by jury, subject to applicable local law and judicial discretion. The presiding judge for any bench trial shall, to the extent reasonably possible, have expertise in IP law or commercial contracts. Alternative dispute resolution methods are waived unless required by law in a sencario-by-scenario basis of specificity. Any party acting in bad faith, including frivolous claims or attempts to circumvent these terms, may be liable for legal fees and damages, provided such penalties are awarded by the court. Trial duration shall follow the controlling jurisdiction’s procedural rules; the rights holder may request expedited handling where legally permissible.</p>
	<p>Any proposal, offer, or attempt to resolve disputes outside of formal judicial proceedings, including but not limited to mediation, arbitration, or private settlement, in cases governed under these Terms shall be considered null and void. Such attempts shall have no legal effect, consistent with the dispute resolution provisions outlined herein, which mandate exclusive adjudication in formal court settings as specified above.</p>
	<p>If any provision of these Terms, Declarations, & Licensing Conditions is held invalid, unenforceable, or unlawful under applicable law, such provision shall be suspended only for the specific instance in which it was found invalid or unconstitutional, and shall resume full force and effect once recognized as constitutional under applicable law, while all remaining provisions continue in full force and effect. These Terms, Declarations, & Licensing Conditions shall take precedence over any prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent agreements, communications, or understandings—written or oral—between any party and the rights holder. No waiver, modification, or partial invalidation of any term shall affect the enforceability of the remainder of these Terms. This includes any scenario in which the opposing party’s documents, contracts, or terms purport to take precedence; in such cases, these Terms shall remain superior and controlling for all interactions with the rights holder and use of the works.</p>
	<p>Official communications must use<a href="https://linktr.ee/qdagbjorthuangington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the designated contact point only</a>. This document supersedes all prior statements or understandings.</p>
